"we had an interesting cross cultural workshop today. about why israeli's are the way they are and where they're coming from and how to deal with them and adjust to living here. some of it was pretty heavy so here's what i wrote as i was processing it all: israel is a heavy place the heat and weight come down on you the second your foot touches holy ground. i feel it pressing - a burden i am not prepared to carry. how can anyone be ready for a place like this; the quiet sadness; the silent pain? a country in mourning living day to day and here i am. will i be crushed by this or will i learn to share the burden; to take part of it upon myself and live here day to day without falling apart? will i grow the thick sabra skin? i must, i think, if i am to survive this; if i am to move on.

"last night i saw a movie at the film festival entitled 'wall'. it was about the security fence and it was very one sided (i.e. not very pro the fence). it was incredibly depressing. very focused on the disadvantages, cost, and the compromises to the palestinians rights. then at the end they showed images of the palestinians climbing over parts of the wall or through the barbed wire (to get to work, not to bomb buses mind you.. . ) but still.. . the worst part was that i was just as disturbed by those images as i was by the situation and the disadvantages the palestinian people (most of whom are not terrorists) are facing. what kind of person does that make me? that i'm concerned for their rights but only until i'm faced with my own vulnerability? when did my right to live become more important than their rights to freedom?

"as some of you may have read or seen on the news, there was a bomb in tel aviv yesterday. since i am not in tel aviv, i'm just fine so not to worry (you wouldn't believe how many people's parents called to check in on them.. . we are in a whole other city!). however, i won't lie and say that i am unaffected. any one who knows me knows how i can let optimism get the best of me. i feel like i let the quiet and uneventfulness of the past few months trick me into thinking i was completely safe. and with being able to see the security wall from my window.. . i think i created a false sense of safety for myself and maybe that was necessary in some ways.. . to get my head around being here and living here.. . but i feel like, if it can happen there, it can happen here, and to be honest (with myself and all of you), it probably will. now, that's not to say that i think i'm in imminent danger. i don't take buses and that helps my chances a lot. i'm not worried about being directly involved. it's way more likely that i'll get hit by a car because the traffic related deaths are way higher here than terrorist related deaths. i'm worried about hearing an explosion. about hearing sirens. about how it'll feel to be in a city when something like that happens. our interns tell us that the first one is the worst. i can't imagine going through it once let alone multiple times. i guess time will tell and i am bracing myself because to think otherwise is to lie to myself about where i am living. i am not writing this so that you will all worry. i don't want you all to worry because i am going to be just fine but this website is to share with you my year. not just what i'm doing but what i'm thinking and how i'm feeling and that's where i am right now. god willing, the year will go by peacefully and i won't have a year that comes close to resembling the one that my intern sari had (when they all had to leave early...). god willing i won't have to deal with any of this. i was too far from tel aviv to hear the explosion or see the ambulances drive by. i was too far to even know it happened until hours later. yet somehow, that explosion shattered a part of my life too: my false sense of security and sadly, for the moment, my optimism.

last night a group of us did havdallah in the park by the windmill. it was fun and beautiful and creative and it made us feel like we had really made it (which we have!). afterwards we went out for dinner to olive and fish which is a great restarant near school and the park and after that we went to a party at a classmates house. all around a great evening. here are some pictures as well as one that i took earlier in the day of a camel passing through the park as we were hanging out there. ,1

"i participated in something amazing last night. every year at this time, there is an art fair in jerusalem. traditionally, the artists set up on ben yehuda st. and there is music and dancing and lots of food and large crowds. since the security situation began a few years ago, the festival was moved to the gates of the old city. this year it was back on ben yehuda for the first time in 3 years. everyone turned out. the crowds were large and excited and i'm told, it was an evening to come out and say, ""we are not afraid!"". and so we did. a group of us went and shopped and ate and sang and danced in the street and it was fantastic. it was ben yehuda the way i remembered it, crowded and thriving, and secure (there were security guards at the entrance to the festival and circulating through the crowds. it felt great to be there and somehow, standing up to danger, none of us felt unsafe. it's one thing not to take a bus. it's another thing not to live your life.

"what a night! tonight the social action committee, of which i am a part, ran a beit cafe (coffee house) fundraiser with a talent show and silent auction. it was fantastic! the talent acts were great (people sang and did funny things - anna can cross her toes and ari can play hava nagila on his head!) and the silent auction (which i organized) went really well. all together we raised about 5500 nis (new israeli shekels) which is about 1500 us dollars!! what a great feeling! throughout the evening i had great moments where i'd look around and be amazed at my fellow classmates. if we can have a night like this, organized in a few days with a few people and a lot of generosity and talent, imagine what we will do and accomplish over the years. as we sang and laughed and did mitzvot together i looked around and tried to imagine looking back on this years down the road. i cannot quite imagine that yet. right now it's enough to just wonder at and about who will are becomming. every day i see our potential, individually and collectively, a little more clearly. i can't wait to continue doing amazing things with these people. i am so lucky to be a part of this.

"on wednesday we ended ulpan early and boarded buses to the gallilee for a 2 day adventure. we travelled towards the north of israel making stops along the way to learn about the first aliyah. we went to the rothchild gardens, which were beautiful and then to the first aliyah museum in zichron ya'akov which is a beautiful town to which i had never been to before. what a view! we stayed at a kibbutz near the golan heights where we had evening services, where the rooms were super clean (i roomed with katie, marcy and lisa s.) and where the breakfast was typically israeli. then the real fun began. we boarded the buses and headed to the jordan river where we went rafting! so much fun! the rafts were big and the rapids (if you could call them that) were miniscule and for the first half of the trip (before the tiny rapids began) we were alowed to jump in each other's boats and thrown people into the water and swim around. i did of course, get thrown in (thanks joel!) but it was refreshing and it made it all the more fun to watch other people get dumped in as well. i rafted with rachel c., david s., tal, sadie and josh. super good times. after that we had a fantastic lunch at a restaraunt on lake kineret (so gorgeous) and then went to the cemetary where rachel the poet and naomi shemer are burried to learn about the 2nd aliyah. seeing their gravestones was moving as i know their poetry and music and have known of them as important israeli figures for most of my life. at the end of the day we took the buses back to jerusalem. it was good to be home (mostly cause we all smelled like the jordan river and really needed to shower!). pictures to follow.

"sometimes i realise things in fleeting moments and it takes a while to get them composed and down on paper (or...computer screen rather...). it's amazing how quickly we've all settled in to a routine here. i no longer feel that it's strange that i live in israel or that i speak and study a different language every day. i no longer notice buses driving buy or worry that the parked cars on the street are going to explode as i walk buy them. the heat is hardly noticable or bothersome. i feel like i've known these people forever.. .  it's only sometimes - moments all too fleeting - when i remember why were here. how amazing it is that i'm here. that these people are here with me. what we're doing here - working toward. i had a moment in ulpan the other day when it occured to me that these people aren't just classmates - they're collegues. some of the people in my class will be in my classes for the next 5 years. some of them will work in the same city as me. all of them will be part of my life forever. it's crazy. then tonight, i had dinner with katie and lisa s. and marcy. the cantorial crew. we brought a chicken to marcy's and she made cuscus and it was great. just sitting around gabbing and i found myself thinking how great it was that i will have these people in my life now. sometimes i get sad when i think about my rabbinic friends who will be at different campuses next year. i don't have those worries with marcy and the girls. i know they're not going anywhere anytime soon. it's comforting. and it occured to me that these women aren't just my collegues. they're my friends, and sitting around and eating and laughing (and being rude!) i knew it was more than that. they are my family too. on a lighter note - i stole pictures from katie and marcy today. some great ones from hezekiah's tunnel and of me being frum in the old city (also a great one of katie and dan). they're all on my webshots page in the trip pictures album. enjoy!

"hang on everyone. this is going to be a long entry. the day started off with a joke. since we had been told to dress appropriately for our visit to the western wall today, i decided to go all the way and wear not only a long skirt (to ankles) but a very frum-looking head scarf. i did it to make my classmates smile and to make a joke of the fact that we can't just go as we are. can't just pray as we are. can never quite feel accepted in ""our"" homeland. at ""our"" wall. anyway, it worked for a while. my classmates laughed. i laughed (especially when anna told me that the head scarf indicated to people that i was married!) and it was fun to be in the old city and not get mean looks from the orthodox crowd. in fact, i got smiles sometimes. felt welcome. was harrassed by orthodox children raising money for yeshivas who thought i'd be sympathetic. things only got better when i offered to carry my friend jo's baby for a while in her snuggly carrier thing. boy did i look like a young frum mother (pictures to follow sometime soon!)!! little did i know. we went to the western wall tunnels which was very cool because i had never been there before. what wasn't cool was that the tunnels empty out into the arab quarter of the old city. now. let me preface this by saying that we were very safe. the western wall tunnel people surround departing groups with a team of security men to escort you back to the jewish quarter. men who have handguns in hand with their fingers all but on the trigger. nobody was going to bother us surrounded by these men. and certainly nothing was going to explode in the arab quarter. but suddenly, it was not so funny to be dressed as an orthodox jew. the outfit, adopted with the intention of making me feel less conspicuous was suddenly a very big failure. luckily the walk back to the jewish quarter was short. never have i been so relieved to be surrounded by orthodox jews. for a while i even felt safe. and then it happened. (don't freak out. i'm fine. everything's fine.) after lunch we were heading back towards the western wall area when we found we couldn't go any farthur. police had blocked off the bottom of the staircase we were on. there was a suspicious object down the street and no one was going anywhere until it had been delt with (which means that someone left a backpack somewhere and the whole area had to be blocked off, the bomb squad had to come in, and it had to be blown up). we stood on the stairs for about 10-15 minutes. patiently for the most part. i actually didn't feel scared. i was impressed with the policeman and the efficeincy of the whole ordeal. people were calm. at first. but people don't like to be caged and in addition to not letting people into the western wall area, the police were also not letting anyone out. while you would think that when there's a bomb scare people would be happy to sit back and listen to the police, this is israel and nothing's that easy. just as we hear the suspicious object being blown up a block or so away (something like a soft pop not a big explosion noise) a riot breaks out at the gate to the western wall. the people wanted out. police were running and people were screaming and it was not pleasant. actually it was pretty upsetting and a little scary. yes. that's me. fine with the suspicious object down the street but scared of riots and upset by the sight of policeman running with raised nightstick type things. anyway, the whole ordeal left me feeling pretty shaken up. today made me feel like i don't know who to be more afraid of. being too jewish means i may not feel safe around arabs, not being jewish enough means i may not feel safe around orthodox jews and in the end it doesn't really matter because all it takes is one person's left behind belongings for everyone to be confronted with mortality and for all hell to suddenly break lose. most days i feel perfectly safe here. most days i argue with others that i'm probably safer here than in most big cities. today made me want to crawl into bed and never come out. and in fact, for the rest of the day, that may be exactly what i do.

"today we had a community service fair so that we could meet people from different organizations and begin to decide where to devote our community service requirement. i went over to the young judaea table after reading the description of their program. basically they need huc students to help plan, lead and facilitate liberal, spiritual prayer experiences (services) for their group of 300 american college freshmen who are doing a year in israel program. these kids have never really been active in religious settings so they want us to help introduce them to different types of prayer and worship styles (traditional, creative, medatative, musical, etc.). so i knew this was right up my ally and in the end, it's where i'm going to volunteer. all this is well and good but not the point of my story. i go up to the table and introduce myself to avi, the leader of the program. avi points to the canada pin on my bag and says, ""where are you from?"" emma: toronto avi: me too! e - really? a - yes. e - that's so cool! a - where did you go to school? e - queen's. a - oh yeah? i worked at york. e - awesome. a - what temple do you belong to. e - i grew up at har zion.. .  a - oh! sheryl nosan was there for a while! e - yeah, she's great.. . and now i'm at kol ami. my dad's the rabbi there. a - oh! you're danny's daughter! i love your dad! i worked with kolel etc. etc. really close friends with nancy (w.a.) etc. etc. actually, i've been to your house before! e - (a little weirded out) really? was i there? a - probably. nancy and david's engagement party? e - i was there! that's really weird. a - yeah. so you're doing the second generation thing? you're dad's great. he knows my dad actually. my dad's a rabbi in winnipeg... and it went on from there. so this is both funny and frustrating. i don't know why i thought i could get away from all of that here. you'd think i'd expect it by now. maybe i'm just sensitive now to wanting to be seen as being here on my own terms. we rk's (rabbi's kids - and there are a good sized group of us in the program) get a lot of, ""oh. you're an rk. no wonder you're here"" and everytime i think, ""gee...thanks for assuming i can think for myself..."" it's funny that these things never really used to bother me. i just really don't want people thinking i got a free ticket here or that i didn't come to this ""calling"" on my own terms... oh well... what can you do? in anycase, dad, avi rose (nathan rose's son) says hi.

"i somehow forgot to talk about havdallah this past week. we (a large group of my classmates and i) had it at noah and adam's house and it was lead by my classmate and friend noam katz who just happens to write amazing jewish music. the energy in the room was incredible and i could go on forever about it but my friend leah describes it beautifully on her blog so here's what she said: last night, during havdalah at noah and adam's, a room teeming with huc students separated the peace of shabbat from the routine of the week. as the room filled with song, with harmony and beauty, love enveloped that space between the sacred and the profane, bringing the two together in a dance that embodied the essence of shalem, of wholeness, of letting go of the rest of the world in search of a peace that is the calm amidst the insanity.

"wow. talk about once in a life time experiences! last night i went with about half of my classmates to a david broza sunrise concert at massada. david broza is a famous israeli musician (singer and guitar player). some say he is israel's version of dave matthews. others say eric clapton. still others say billy joel.. .  i had heard of david broza before and had, in fact, seen him in central park when i was on staff at kutz camp and we took the campers to participate in an israel rally. i hadn't paid too much attention to him then though because i was doing my job and looking out for the campers. so i didn't go to this concert because i was a fan. i went because it was a sunrise concert at massada, meaning it began at 3am in the middle of the desert at the base of one of the coolest mountains on the planet and one of my favorite places in isreal, and ended with the rising of the sun which i had seen from the top of massada on my nfty israel trip and knew to be an amazing sight. about 30 of the 70 huc students went to this concert but we broke ourselves down into smaller groups for the purpose of transportation. we went in 3 sheiruts (taxi buses), some which went straight to massada from jerusalem (about 2 1/2 hour drive) and some (like mine) which first went to arad where we had to pick up our tickets (other people had picked them up in tel aviv earlier in the week). arad is a small city just south of massada. our group (16 of us in 2 sheiruts) left jerusalem at 6 in the evening and drove to arad. the drive was beautiful. there is a heavyness about jerusalem that you don't always feel when you're in the city but when it leaves you as you leave the city, you notice it. between our newfound lightweightedness (i think i just created a word) and the gorgeous veiw, we were elated. my last trip to israel was spent mostly in the south so as we drove down into the desert i felt like i was coming home; back to a place of familiarity and happy memories. anyway, we picked up our tickets and went to a bar for dinner and drinks. we had a grand old time eating, drinking, playing pool, shmoozing and getting excited for the concert. after that we bought tickets for the bus to massada which would leave at 2:15am. since it was only 11:30pm we found a park to chill out in and kill time. some of us slept while others played frisbee and chatted. those of us that wanted to sleep spread out blankets on the grass and quickly learned that it is very cold in the desert at night. despite our various sweatshirts and blankets we were quite cold. luckily, we are all friendly peaople and did not mind squeezing our bodies close up to one another under one blanket. as i lay under the sky in arad, shivering, i learned two very important things. the first is that a tired rachel crossley and a tired emma equal a lot of giggling. the second thing is that if you ever have to go to a cold country (or sleep in a cold desert) and you can only take one person with you, tal is the person to take. he emits warmth! around 1:30am we woke ourselves up, warmed ourselves up, found some bathrooms to use, and headed for the bus. the bus left on time but took longer than the expected 45 min. to get there due to the heavy traffic created by the concert attendants, police, and security people. finally we got there though and it was well worth the wait. the concert was set up at the foot of massada at the back between the roman ramp and herod's palace (for those of you that have been there and know what i'm talking about). we sat in the stands or on blankets and watched the amazing concert. broza is an incredible musician and you didn't have to be familiar with his music in order to appreciate his talent and the atmosphere. the concert started in the dark. just the lights from the stage. then certain parts of massada (herod's palace for example) were lit up and could be seen clearly from where we sat below. at one point, the whole line of wall at the top of the mountain was lit up. it was incredible. after 2 hours of great music and moving lighting, the sky began to lighten and the mountain and the sea below us began to become more and more visible. david worked his music to a climax with everybody's favorite songs at the end so we found ourselves standing and singing as the sun rose above us. it was truely an amazing, moving, beautiful morning. i am incredibly tired but so glad that i went. below is a picture from the concert and you can find more on my album on webshots. i will continue to add pictures as well as i get them from friends so check back now and again. i'm going to sleep now. it's been a long but worthwhile 24 hours. a day i will surely never forget.

"wow...this year went by so fast. first year at claremont's already over, isn't that weird? i mean so many things happened this year and now they're gone, just like that. strange how life progresses. life's like the gravitron. i'm too scared to go on it, and i'm always left outside, looking in. watching people strapped in, along for the ride while i see them spinning around in a swirling mass of colour. the people inside are the risk-takers. they're willing to grab life by the horns (sorry for the cliche) and be whipped in every direction. no matter how many times they're hurt, they still hold on with everthing they've got. it's scary how fast we age, yet we never really ask why it happens so fast. it just..happens. what is age anyway? you can't feel it, you can't see it, but it's always with you. kinda like air. it makes you live everyday, makes you strive to achieve anything you want. there's so much we need to know and learn in such a small amount of time. seeing my brother graduating makes me think about this a little more than i have before. think about it, we're expected to be married and starting a family by the age of 30. that's only another 15 years away, tops. my first 15 went by quickly, another 15 will come up just as fast. who knows what things we'll gain or lose by then? do you actually know what you're life's going to be like later on? no, you don't and you won't until then, but you can steer it in the right direction. just by observing people, you can tell if they're steering themself in the right direction, and people my age, aren't. it's ironic really. the people that need the most help, don't want to ask for it and don't take things seriously, but the ones that don't need the help, think they need it. only a few people are smart enough to turn their lives around, but sometimes they figure it out too late. *sigh* so many things to think about, too many things to ponder, only in one lifetime do you recieve your opportunities.

(ya'll know who i'm talkin' 'bout) arrrgh she just wouldn't leave me alone! you'd think she would get the hint by now, geez...it's like everytime you turn around she's there! lol leech!!! but hey, wutcha gunna do with that damn puddle? she'll do lotsa stuff to you and expect to be liked after she's driven the knife into your back like 20 times. grrreat...i hate this damn clingy thing. i already have a shadow thank you very much! *sigh*...i'll never have a normal life. too many things in the way of one. well for me anyway. everyone seems just so happy-go-lucky and here i am sulking. you may be reading this and saying ""wtf!?"", but this is what's going on in the inside. no one ever sees it, except me. being happy is so my thing right? sure, only in school though. when i'm around people i like, all my problems just slip away quietly. never seen nor thought of when i'm with friends. you guys make me feel waaay better. it's my escape, my sanctuary. you may not realize it, but you guys do a lot for me. for this, i thank you. it's when i'm at home, by myself, that this stuff comes back to haunt me. sorry grace, i'm being too serious aren't i? well, my life is serious so there's no helping it. that's all i got to say for now so, peace up, a-town.

"weird weather we're having...i swear it matches my moods all the time! this morning was so crappy when we played colours, then it got prettyful this afternoon. i felt really gross this morning too, then i was happy, now i'm blah. uckyful feelings. *sigh* so many things to think about, so many opportunities slipped past me...feels like i've been flipped upside down, shaken for all i'm worth and have just been set upright again. trying to find your bearings is hard, especially at this age. i mean there's so many things that stand in your way nowadays. so much easier when we were little...lol i sound so serious, this isn't like me! maybe i'm talking about this because i watched a certain movie on the weekend about not wanting to growing up flying away to neverland...i do admit, there's advantages and disadvantages, but i still don't like the thought of it. so many mixed feelings to sort out. why should i have to go through this? it's waaay too complicated for my liking. guess it's just part of the ""grand design""...(think i've been reading too many fantasy books ^^') arrrgh i'm too naive with the ways of the world. wish i wasn't so much, i'd be so much easier to adjust with certain things. i'm walking a path in the dark it seems like. i don't know where i'm going, tripping and trying to get back up. exhausted and bruised, struggling to overcome obstacles i can't see until they hit me square in the face...just a little insight on the way i feel sometimes. i'm oblivious and point out the obvious. classic combo for an idiot, eh? i'm so clueless sometimes...well, guess this is all i can write for now,(kinda drained, you know how it is) i'll write in here a little later.

"well, haven't written in here for like the longest time it feels like. i found a quote on the internet that inspired me to post something: ""life is a waste of time, time is a waste of life. so get wasted all of the time and have the time of your life."" cleverand half true, i think. sometimes life is a waste of time, but rarely. time is definitelynota waste of life since without time, no life would exist. heh, the last part is the best buti doubt i'd wanna get wasted all of the time...o_o oh well, back to my world... i felt so bad yesterday. i hated myself, for everything.actually, it's been going onfor thepast week...why do i feel we allaren't equal? it's not fair thatsome peoplehavesome thingsthat others envy them for. ""it all works out in the end,"" right? well where's the end and when's it coming? for many, it can never work out completely. there's only a small possibility that anything will be alright. i know i sound so negative, but it's all true. you always want what you can't have and no one's ever satisfied with what they do possess. there are so many things that can and are denied to you, and there's nothing you can do about it. compensations are what you recieve instead or nothing is given at all. i feel like i've been denied what i want and denied even a simple compensation instead. but there's a reason for everything, right? wrong. the only reason i'm not given the things i want or even deservethe most, is because the world is lettingothersget lucky on my misfortunes. although, i do have to take into consideration the unluckyevents that happen to the fortunate sometimes. i don't see them suffer as much as i usually do though. either that or they refuse to show it. wish i could refuse to show my sorrow when i've been dealt a horrible hand. maybe that's why better things happen to people who don't show their unhappiness. fate is weaving my tapestry slowly but surely, then snipping the strings faster than the loom can work...

"ah. finally free. no school, no worries. damn, it's gunna be a nice 2 months off! *sigh*...it's off to a better start than any other summer. i was such a loner! (what's the difference from now, eh? '-__-) i'm still a loner at heart ^_~. anyway...i just came back from the movies and i saw shrek 2(finally)! i have dubbed thy donkey/dragon/mutant babies, dragonkies! now i want one! lol! as you may have guessed, i'm quite sugar high from all that candy i ate at the theatre! ^^; so pretty much, this post is randomness all the way! muwahahahahahaha! hah! i can see you shaking your head! don't you laugh at me! only i can laugh at me :d! hehe...well now that that's over, why don't i talk about something, uh, less pointless ^^'? hmmm, let's see...i saw my brother graduate on tuesday and it was so weird to see him up on stage! oh and all the pretty dresses! ooooh can't wait till i grad! it's going to be soooo fun picking out and trying on dresses until i find the perfect one! but then again, gradding is so nerve-racking. i mean, you gotta go off to college or university after the summer, not lil ol' claremont anymore. you gotta make it on your own. when i saw the ceremony, i thought to myself, ""i'm going to go through this in 3 years,"". three years isn't that long either ya know. it's strange how we've come so far, yet we haven't even seen half of our lives yet. o_o i'm really scaring myself now! think i'd better go before i start reminiscing about my childhood again...

acording to internet rumors the backstreet boys will tour asia for their upcoming album. their untitled album is set for a october/november release. much to the amazement of this bsb fan i think it's a safe bet that they'll conquer the world as they havebefore. ,1
"hello, i thought that i might update my site a little bit. this blog is to report that i wanted to tell everyone just how much the backstreet boys mean to me. their music, their group, everything. i suppose that you could say that the backstreet boys are going to occupy most of my life which is the reason for the blogger website. emoji  ",1
the backstreet boys have been an intricate part of my life for the past 7.5 years and nothing much has changed about my fandom. but i would just like to say that as an adult fan i can say that the backstreet boys have touche my life in ways that they may never know about. this site is a tribute to my bsb devotion. no i'm not obsessed with them. just devoted and love them. emoji  i will use this spot to keep up to date about current bsb events so stay tuned. emoji  ,1

this page is to clear up any rumors or gossip with the boys. ,1
"rumors, rumors, rumors. there have been rumors floating around the internet of a october/november release for the backstreet boys's upcoming album. although this has yet to be confirmed i have no doubts that this will be a hot new thing for the boys. i think that the backstreet boys will prove to the critics as they always have that just because they haven't been around for a while that means that they can't start over again. early next year the boys are planning a world wide tour of small and intimate venues so that they can get reaquainted with their fans. there have also been rumors floating around that brian will bring his wife and 1.5 year old son baylee with them but it will only be at certain places for fear that it may be too much for leighanne and the baby. leighanne has stated that she and brian want baby baylee to know what his daddy does for a living. everyone seems to think that because the backstreet boys haven't been in touch with their fans that it means that the backstreet boys are over but in reality the backstreet boys have a new album coming out in october. emoji  ",1
"i feel like i ate enough for 2 of me today. even 3 of me. i had both lunch and dinner out, with one of my sisters and separately with my parents. ugh i can't move now. my fortune from dinner says ""your example will inspire others"". i want to know how exactly that is a fortune. i mean, when did they stop with the actual fortunes and start with the cryptic messages? i wanted something like, ""you will be very lucky tomorrow"", or ""that one thing you really wish for will occur within a week"", or i would even settle for ""you will meet a very handsome man and have fabulous sex"". that's seriously not too much to ask for, right? i also got judged for my naughty behavior/attitude today. sorta pissed me off. i may have been acting like a petulant child, but i feel i have right to act that way when i want to. especially after the past year or so. i've become a lot more involved with my mother because she is disabled and is losing the ability to do a lot of day to day tasks, like paying bills and other stuff that needs to be done. my computer is doing funny things, the font keeps changing size. argh stop. so anyway, i am not having a happy day. the only thing that really helped was the idea that i get to go buy a new shirt to wear with my khakis for my meeting (had to throw that in, still very excited). oh plus i was going to clean tonight. in case anyone exciting gets to see my house anytime soon.

"ok. friendly mood this week, huh? but honestly. all i know is, i was sound asleep and dreaming at about 1-ish last night. until i dreamt i was hearing screaming and flashing lights. i think the flashing light thing was someone pulling into my driveway. i don't know about the whole screaming thing, but i do know my neighbors were outside smoking when i motivated out of bed to check on what the heck was going on. i swear they never sleep. someone told me they got home at about 3am once, and he (neighbor guy) was out working in his garage. working. at 3 in the morning. i am so in need of sleep that i didn't even curse at them this morning. trust me, they would have deserved it. oh and new developments. i wrote zb a quick email to say hi and sorry i haven't seen him around much and have a nice rest of the summer (a generally friendly email). and he wrote me back. something like instantaneously. so i am not the email leper i thought i was for a while. still haven't heard from my prof. yet. i am still checking email something like every 2 hours. maybe i should write him again? i mean really, can you be too pushy when you want something?

"i am pouting. alot. now it is like me and the prof i want to work with are dating, since heisn't writing me back. ugh! and i ran into zoo boy today (one of my former crushes). that was interesting. it went something like this: bunhug: oh! you scared me. (since he creeped up on me) zoob: sorry. so are you done with the observation? bunhug: yup. zoob: i was wondering if you were still alive... bunhug: (wondering if now is the best time to remind him he stopped emailing me...) yup, ive been around... *and then some other nonsense was spoken here* zoob: i had to get up early yesterday to take somebody to the airport. bunhug: (wondering if i should ask if it was in fact his girlfriend) oh yeah? zoob: ok, i need to go work on something or other...*as we both walk in separate directions* yay. my life is so interesting. it is encounters like these that make me say boys are stupid. and in the long run, saying it doesn't help any. it doesn't change things. so anyway. from this conversation and how i have been anxiously awaiting my reply from neb.(i check my email at least 4 times a day), you can tell its shaping up to be a less than stellar week. maybe i am too pushy. i like my pushiness though. im the queen of pushiness. at least it helps you get your way. oh and work is making me extra tired lately. im not sure how much longer i can handle the opening at 5am thing. the most interesting thing thats happened so far this week is that i get to maybe help out with orientation. talk about study abroad or something. woo hoo. slow down, roller coaster of life.

"allright. i actually had a fairly good time last night. m and i went down to kc and ate at the macaroni grill, and then went over to the plaza and wandered a little. my sister (who lives in kc) gave me a call and said she might see us out later. so she went to a sort of reception thing for some people she works with who are getting married, which was also, conveniently, on the plaza. so d and i stopped in for a little while, to say hi and stuff. and i had a beer. ugh. drinking does not agree with me, even one beer makes me a little tipsy. i had a pretty good time though. it was the first time m had been to the macaroni grill, which surprised me a lot, i guess since i've ate there so often. she was duly impressed by the operetic singing waiters and waitresses, and the crayons. that really is one of my favorite restraunts, im lucky it hasn't been spoiled for me by my going there with some ex-bf. the plaza, on the other hand, has been a little spoilt for me. the barnes and noble there... bad memories. plus, we saw some girl holding hands with her boyfriend as they were walking along, and i was like ""dammit. i want that."" not specifically her boyfriend or anything, just the ability to hold someones hand while walking, without them freaking out and practically yelling at me for it. i guess thats what i get though. we all make choices and i guess i just need to work on realizing why that one didn't work out for me. it should be fairly simple. you'd think. he didn't want to be ""in love"" with me. he wanted to sleep with me and was happy having me around, every now and then. but i wanted to love him. that's why ive been kicking myself for the past 3 years. it's really time to be over it though. it was time to be over it years ago. i just need to find someone i like. someone new. thats the main problem with living in kansas. it's so difficult to meet new people. it's good to think about him less though. it makes me feel a little more done with everything about him. if only i didn't have to see him every week or so.

"i think that's what my family was trying to say the other night. that i need more human interaction in my life. my father keeps telling me that work isn't everything. i can't stand people who sit around and do mindless things like watch tv all day, every day. i have a few shows i like watching in the evenings, but it is by far one of my least favorite things to do. i understand the ability to relax in one's home, in front of the tv. i have enjoyed that every now and then, having a nice quiet time in. watching tv and doing nothing and needing to do nothing. i feel so useless though, if that is all i do. i like being busy. i like having deadlines and projects and goals i am working towards. i have known this about myself for a long, long time. it keeps you from having to stop and think really. about anything, sad things especially. work is an escape for me. it's not that i'm burying my head in the ground or anything. if i happen to meet someone i instantaneously enjoy being in the company of, i won't ignore them. i just so rarely feel that anymore. more and more, i like being alone. i am comfortable by myself. i am happy in my skin, as many have said. when i was still dating looser-boy, whom i refer to quite often in the most derogative of terms, if you haven't allready noticed, he asked me if i was happy. i said i was content. satiated, if you will. i got the reply that that was a bad thing, a bad way to be. to be honest, it had been quite a long while, years, since i had felt remotely right with the world. i think that at that time, that percise moment in space and place when i was with him, i just needed something. something to ground me from feeling like i was reeling from all the blows i was receiving. someone to touch. touch is very underrated. i was happy just to be around him. i guess thats why it has taken me so long to understand why he didn't feel the same. and why i still feel sad about it every now and then. i do miss him. but i think its become missing more than him. missing the act of being with someone. of belonging with someone? i don't know. missing having someone you feel you could say anything to. having someone to go home to. i miss his cat, almost more than him. how ironic is that? i don't really know how i thought it would end though. i think we were doomed. from the start. yugh! i'm through with all this relationship junk. i'm how i am. screw my family.

"my semester is shaping up to be a fun one. i'm taking 18 hours, which i have done before, but not for a while. it helps that 6 of those 18 are criminal justice workshops. i've never taken any of them before, but i've heard it's a quick and dirty way to get extra hours in. and they are supposed to be easy. my schedule is as follows... genetics - mwf at 8am and lab on tues morning - 4 cred hours chem 151 - mwf at 10am, recitation at 12 on mon, and lab at 5:30pm mon - 5 credit hours!!! comparative seminar - mw 1:30-2:45 - 3 cred hours oranized crime - weekend workshop (2 weekends in a row) - 3 cred hours crime scene analysis - 'nother weekend workshop - 3 cred hours im excited for all of them except the chemistry. at least people i know will be in all of the classes. that's what i get for being an undergrad for so long. last night after dinner, we went for more ice cream on mass street. this guy ran by us as we were standing outside, and my comment was ""i want that."" i think it was my entire family's plan to make me feel badly for not liking bar scenes, but what can i say? it sort of turned into ""you have no social life"" attack on me. im focused, i can't help it. i don't think i will meet anyone i will like in a bar, because that's not exactly the best place to meet people, in my view. even my dad was making fun of me for not having a date for quite a while. i could have a date, if i wanted one, that's just not something im thinking about right now. i don't really have much time to spend on a boy anyway, so he would probably feel neglected. anyway, my fam can be pretty catty. i think it's hard for people to understand that i like school so much. and they don't understand that im a little afraid to get into anything serious right now. don't really enjoy getting my heart stomped on, so im trying to do it less and less. and plus, with the possibility of moving in a year, what's the point any way?

"so the bloody frogs managed to pull something out of the bag. typical really especially as we lost the game on penalties (far to much de ja vou). but life goes on and it should at least highlight how utterly crap hesky is (whenever he gets the ball he falls over faster than an italien in the penalty box, who says man hasnt yet reached light speed). any way its back to school tommorow (boo hiss) which should be mildly amusing, simply to see the little amout of work were going to be doing (less for me of course). its going to be odd though because it already feels like the summer holidays. on a different note i just read ojs blog and saw his favourite films list. to say i was shocked would be a bit like describing a polar bear wearing shades inside a fridge as mildly cool. so ive decided to put up my list of ten favourites. if theres any ive missed out i probably havent seen em (or my bitch of a sister has over recorded them before i could watch em). 1. leon: stylish, sweet, superbly acted and directed and ludicrously slick and moving. also any film with jean reno has to be good. 2. bill and teds excellent adventure + bill and teds bogus journy: comon these films rock. classic lines ""ted who was joan of arc"" reply ""er, noahs wife"" and the best ever parody of a classic film (ie the silver seal parody when they play twister with death) 3. fight club: god brad pitt is cool in this movie. not only superbly made but also one hell of a mind fuck. 4.the matrix: just rocks, nuff said really 5.trainspotting: best film soundtrack ever, best monologue (the choose life one). simply one of the most energetic vibrant films ever. 6.monty python and the holy grail: to be honest this could of quite easily been the life of brian but it doesnt really matter as they are respectively the two funniest films ever made. 7. city of god: great great film told very well shot beatifully and made all the more amazing because its a true story 8.star wars: lets face it light sabers and ewoks rule! 9.pirates of the caribbean: plot holes you can drive a bus through, but who cares this is simply the most entertaining film i have ever seen, which is after all what the cinema is all about. 10.gladiator: i just love this film, quite moving, brilliant acting and a superbly haunting soundtrack (though i've always wanted to know what happened to maximus's dog) thats it, i bet i have forgotten at least one but hey i love all these films (so should you - unless your french, fucking zidane) ",0

"finished last business studies paper at 4:00 today which was a bit odd i am not really used to finishing exams that late (although on thursday i'm going to be finishing nearer five so it isnt that bad). im now totaly nakered from all the work + not getting enough sleep the night before (the army were obviously enjoying having a lot of fun in their helicopters last night). judging by my luck ive skrewed up the biology despite the paper not being the hardest that ive seen, didnt revise the right bits as usual. luckily business studies was fine (despite having two 16 mark questions and the lowest marked question being out of 8, of which of course there was just the one.) however my hand now feels like its been wnaking inccessantly for about a year (siack image but hey it fits). also today i have learnt to hae my sister even more. i was helping the cow get her new phone to get a signal (something that now seems virtualy impossible in our house unless your phone also happens to be a microwave) when she stamped on my bad toe because i was trying to get it to work (which ii did manage ). of course natraly it stopped working moments later and my sister burst out crying(shes 21). how i survive with my fucked up family is anyones guess(to anyone reading this who knows me i am actually the most sane person in my family, daft as it sounds) answer to yesterdays question is black sabbath and paranoid incidentaly q have just rated oasis definately maybe as the best british album ever with morning glory not even making the grade of the top 50 now call me a philistine but somethings got to be wrong with that.

"today has once again been wasted. i seemed to have spent it all trying to revise, yet as so often happens i ended up looking at the birdies. for a bloody long time. well lets face it its a damn site more interesting than actually revising. what makes this flagrant time wasting worse is that the exams are tomorrow and i now seem to have five of them to do. typical really, it would all be fine if i hadn't cocked up the biology in january and only got a c (a high one mind) when i should of got a a after all thats what i had got in the mock and was predicted (bugger and indeed double bugger). what this leaves me with is one hell of an exam fest tomorrow. in total i am in the exam room for around four hours fifty minutes. wup-de-fucking-do. on a lighter note (before you all break out the violins anyway) its only four days till euro 2004 starts with england ready to give france a decent agincourt of a wupping on sunday (though unlike agincourt are odds are a bit better though unfortunately the queen wont be captening the team on the pitch which is a shame) now for the caption competition of the day (if any body can be arsed) name the song these lyrics are taken from ""people think i'm insane because i'm frowning all the time"" end ",0

"ah those magic words: summer holiday. eight weeks of doing absolutely nothing. can't beat it really. however it is during this most wonderful of times that you may experience one of the worlds worst torments: the pissing off nagging sergeant majoresque parents. okay it may not be to bad for some but my parents are so high up the pissing off scale that a whole new one has had to be invented, just for them (and fernandez who probably even beats them). the parents latest niggle is that i should get a job. that's tantamount to telling a vampire to order garlic bread with his margerita. its just a nono. holidays are for wasting utterly while doing sod all. they aren't for working, there is enough of that during term time (even for the me, especially as i ended up doing history. read five highly interesting books on tudor domestic policy then write a bloody essay, oh wupee). however this holiday seems to be the most action packed one i am ever going to have. this is mainly down to me going off on ccf camp which will involve a day of paintballing apparently to improve any soldierly skills any of us have. this is of course bollocks and is basically an excuse to waste teachers with paintballs (the huge irony being that one of them is an art assistant). i couldn't be arsed to find much new music today so cheated and used media player to find some for me urllink enjoy in accordance with the prophesy ",0

""how to be a happy teenager"". yes, i hear you, you're asking yourselves ""what? our beloved damien is reading a self-improvement book? what in god's name?"" well, i'll tell you this. i'm only reading it because the old man wants me to. why? well, let me tell you a little story of what happened the day i got my report cards back. i was lounging in my room, cool and suave, when suddenly i heard the door to my house open, and i knew my parents had returned from the school, and thus, had finished picking up my grades. the dull, patterned footsteps of my father raised up the flight of stairs, and i decided to face my fears of him shouting in my face for getting a c in math. but lo and behold, he shouted at me for not getting a b in computer! ah, computer class, and a computer teacher who's so fucking retarded that you could stone him to death with jelly and he wouldn't realise it until he's lying in the ground dead. well, he probably wouldn't realise it even then. back to my story. i argued with my dad, and i am within reason for this. i know i deserved more than a fucking c for computer. i told him my teacher is a complete idiot and etc, and that if i saw him any time soon i would speak to the bastard myself. my father seemed to accept this, but with him, he never lets up. two days later, he tells me and my sister he's got this book called ""how to be a happy teenager"". now, i once more protest, and tell him that those books are bollocks, and that i'm happy enough with my life as is. he tells me that i should be more acceptant of other people's ideas, and that not everything i don't like is stupid. he told me that if i truly liked my life, why did i get a c for computer. i lost my mind, and went into crazy dammo mode. i told him once more that its my fucking teacher who's at fault here. and then the truth slipped out from him. my com teacher had told my father ""i don't enjoy programming"". now, allow a moment to ponder this. why, if i don't like programming, do i have visual basic on my computer? well, i let my father ponder that very question, and he did not have an answer. but, regardless, i am now forced into reading this crap arse book all because my fucking computer teacher gave me a fucking c. that cunt crapping fool. well, i'm off until thursday-friday, 'till then my splendid readers, dammo out.

"doom 3, to hell and back. well dammo went with a game preview, so i will too. ever wanted to stay up all night, scared shitless, wondering what the hell is outside waiting for you? no neither have i, but that's not the point. the point is that doom 3 has set the new standerd for fps games. besides id software creating the bloody catagory in the first place, id are known for releasing rock solid game engines which define the gaming industry. anyone who is anyone has played the original doom. if someone told me they have never played it before, i wouldn't hesitate in punching them in the face right on the spot. who can forget the crappy midi music, the growling as you walk down a lonley corridor, or blasting the shit out of a monster at point blank range with the beloved shotgun? the next installment of the doom series is nothing short of an visual experience. nvidia have pumped out thier 6800 ultra that supports engines for doom 3 for christ's sake. you know it must be good. and it couldn't come soon enough. id software have put a lot of time and effort, with development starting right after quake 3 was released. level design looks nothing short of amazing. shadows are catsed on models themselves, with distinct realism never seen before. animation is fluid and flows together perfectly and gameplay was designed to be done alone in the dark... of course, with detail comes lack of quantity, as there is no way, with the amount of detail in each model, that you can have too many models at one. this means that the shit load of monsters that doom was known for, will not be as present. small price to pay, but still. you will want a damn good computer though. about 2.4 ghz with that beloved 6800 ultra and a shit load of ram should do you. pity i'm still on a pentium 3 huh.

"there comes a time on ones life where you just sit back and wonder 'why don't i go out and jump on some crocodiles?' well of course you do, it's a turning point and everyones life. you know you have grown up once you have thought about this. now although everyone thinks this, one man acted on it, and hence became an idol. a ambassader, if you will, to the rest of the world, that now represents a little speck of dust known as australia. his name, is steve. steve bloody irwin. now don't get me wrong, great bloke, done a lot for the wildlife and whatnot. sure he nearly got his kid eaten, but that little incident can be overlooked. i mean look at all the great stuff he's done. i've been to his zoo, and although i didn't see him, although the lines were ridiculously long and full of tourists, although the poor structure of his zoo outlines the rushed buildings and extensions put forward due to a sudden rise in fame, and although it is just a little bit on the expensive side, it's worth it to see crocodiles being raised away from their natural environment. i mean seriously, who wouldn't want to be fed in front of a thousand visitors, cheering and taking photos of you? i sure wouldn't mind it. if i had a choice between living in a river, or living in a small pen being looked at all day even when i take a shit, i would take the latter in a second. onto the next point. who the hell talks like steeve bloody irwin? apparently, according to those oh so smart americans, we all do. and why shouldn't one person represent the way in which a whole country? you know it makes sense. ( i can't imagine you people speaking otherwise- dammo ) 'crikey! look at this beauty!' i got another idea, steve darling. shoot yourself in the head, or at least stop talking like a over crazed orgasming pigmy. 'have a go at this!' how about no, friend. don't get me started on the movie. the only good thing coming out of that movie was the perve. and no, not on steve's wife, the other chick. we know a lot of that film was in your park steve, nice try buddy. the overly used sterotypes were second only to the terrible dialogue, and to top it all off - the ending was as good as my maths ability (which is honestly quite bad) [ don't forget your english- dammo ]. i guess you could say i'm not his biggest fan.

"well i decided to make a blog because ray said that it would be fun. well welcome to my blog space. a little about me, i am a musician who plays the piano and the organ. yes the organ, it's the one you hear at church for weddings, funerals, and sunday masses. there are so many jokes you can make about this, but lets try to keep it clean. so there is a lot of work that i need to catch up on this evening, so i shall keep this first posting short. choral service lists need to be made for the choir term which starts in a couple of weeks. it is actually somewhat of a daunting task to choose good music for the catholic church. crap has proliferated into church music now, and it has become the norm is so many church. it's too depressing, how cocktail music is allowed into the sacred mass, and how many people enjoy it. after being at my job for two years i am happy to say that the repertoire has grown. right now we have enough anthems and motets to last the entire church year, however there is so much more music that i need to teach them. this year we will be doing an all-british theme. the works of britten, matthias and willcocks for christmas, during holy week its going to be baristow and morley, and of course the tradition latin for the good friday service and the tenenbrae service. so really the work never really stops in the summer months while the choir is off. does anyone watch the casino on fox? like most of their stuff its ok, except for the simpson's which is the best show in the world. if you don't think so, write a comment and tell me why, i bet you can't. anyway, it's a pretty good show and the music on there is ok. matt dusk who sings there is good, but when i was listening to his cd he need some more expression, but it's still very good. back to the show, it's a reality show, imagine that, of 2 friends who buy the golden nugget, and try to make money off of it. i don't know if they are making any money, but i'm sure the amount they get from fox to film there is pretty good. all the best to everyone and remember that his blog will be at the same blog time and on the same blog channel. mark ",1

"ah, lovely jubbly, what a perfect start to a day - jog into work then go for a swim. can't complain, really! might not be the world's most exciting/rewarding/well-paid/challenging job, but at least there are some perks... on the down-side though (me, the eternal pessimist...), it's starting to get pretty bloody baking in our office now. the air-con doesn't work properly since we're halfway between either end, and we have a large room (about 25m2) facing the sun most of the day, it gets quite unpleasant. there is a solution: working in one's underwear. but no, perhaps that's not the most cunning plan. pulling the window blinds down helps a bit, but then we lose the gorgeous view we have out over the hills and the sea... ok, stop complaining james, just listen to yourself! fair enough. in other, more interesting news, the new web-site is well on its way to being released to the public. our resident part-time network guru is going to be implementing a test ""passthrough proxy"" tomorrow for the site, which basically means we can do funky stuff with certain urls, among other things. to completely change the subject, it looks like i'll be coming back to france early from our planned month in finland. working from there is going to be a pain in the posterior, and means that we'll need to stay in helsinki for two full weeks... so i'll be leaving my better half up there to face the polar bears, and i'll be back here in france all alone for two weeks. (cue lone violin playing a heart-breakingly sad tune). nah, it'll be fine, and it'll give me the opportunity to get some work done for my part-time job... actually, it'll be wierd, that'll be the longest time we'll have been apart for years. (that violin is still playing, you know!) ",1
"back from my short, five-day holiday, with two things changed since i left: 1) being 26, i'm now officially well on my way to 50... and: 2) i'm also well on my way to turning into a ""leather person"", an eloquent term for the old people you see on the beach who spend all day there tanning, and have skin so tanned it looks like leather... i'm not really proud of either of the above, but neither can be avoided, right? technically the second could be, but there are few things more pleasant than lying on the beach for an hour or two in the early afternoon, and soaking up the sun. the beaches are starting to get packed now though, what with all the tourists coming down here, but it's not as bad as it will be in august (another reason for going to finland!). it gets to the point where you practically can't walk to the sea because people are packed together like sardines... you can imagine the state of the water as well, with all those kiddies running around, adding their un-welcome contributions. the best thing about going on holiday is not being at work. the worst thing about going on holiday is getting back to work, having your e-mail inbox crammed with urgent things to do, and trying to remember everything you had in your mind before you left... last week i was told that my ""other-half"" at work twisted his wrist over the weekend, so he's taken four weeks off for it to heal. as he was looking after the web stuff, it means that i now have to go back to doing that, and drop the siebel implementation project, at least until he gets back... i guess i'm happy about that, siebel's not the most exciting product to work with, to put it lightly! it's supposed to look good on your cv, but i reckon that you shouldn't get good at doing something you don't want to do... right, now i'm off to try and wade through this mountain of work i have to do before lunch-time (1 hour and 3 minutes left!).

"that pink concert last night was wicked! it's amazing how someone so small can have such an incredible stage presence... just got back now from lunch. went down to cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. the french aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. surprising really, when you see how many french people order ""steak tartare"" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). i love sushi though. i'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people i know. it's one of those ""aquired tastes"" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce, you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... hmm. my mouth's watering just at the thought of it! if you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, i suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber ""maki"" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. if you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna ""maki"", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. so, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or ""fatty tuna"" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... if you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it. ok, enough about sushi now, i need to work... emoji  going to see ""i, robot"" tomorrow night in cannes - really looking forward to it.

"that pink concert last night was wicked! i've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. there was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in french) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to pink. it's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. she even spoke some french during the concert, like: ""bonsoir, je m'appelle pink, enchanté!"" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. the concert was in juan-les-pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! we actually got a ride down with billou, james and jeannine (james' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top audi a4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... the trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. but still, one wicked evening. i wish we'd gone to that david guetta live performance down in la siesta night-club last weekend... i'm sure he'll back back next year. jogged/ran into work again this morning. you know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. for example, last night when we got back from the concert, i shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did i think that it might be raining in the morning... and you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... that's one of the great things about this place! just got back now from lunch. went down to cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. the french aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. surprising really, when you see how many french people order ""steak tartare"" for lunch...

(that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). i love sushi though. i'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people i know. it's one of those ""aquired tastes"" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce, you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... hmm. my mouth's watering just at the thought of it! if you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, i suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber ""maki"" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. if you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna ""maki"", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. so, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or ""fatty tuna"" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... if you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it. ok, enough about sushi now, i need to work... emoji  going to see ""i, robot"" tomorrow night in cannes - really looking forward to it.

(that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). i love sushi though. i'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people i know. it's one of those ""aquired tastes"" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce, you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... hmm. my mouth's watering just at the thought of it! if you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, i suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber ""maki"" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. if you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna ""maki"", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. so, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or ""fatty tuna"" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... if you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it. ok, enough about sushi now, i need to work... emoji  going to see ""i, robot"" tomorrow night in cannes - really looking forward to it.

"that pink concert last night was wicked! i've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. there was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in french) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to pink. it's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. she even spoke some french during the concert, like: ""bonsoir, je m'appelle pink, enchanté!"" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. the concert was in juan-les-pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! we actually got a ride down with billou, james and jeannine (james' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top audi a4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... the trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. but still, one wicked evening. i wish we'd gone to that david guetta live performance down in la siesta night-club last weekend... i'm sure he'll back back next year. jogged/ran into work again this morning. you know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. for example, last night when we got back from the concert, i shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did i think that it might be raining in the morning... and you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... that's one of the great things about this place! just got back now from lunch. went down to cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. the french aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. surprising really, when you see how many french people order ""steak tartare"" for lunch...

"it's the summer, that normally means it's supposed to be quiet and calm, and most people go off on holiday... the only one of those that's true in my case is the last one, unfortunately! it's really hectic here now, what with thierry off on sick leave (he twisted his wrist, and took six weeks off) leaving me with all the crap that he'd been accumulating over the last couple of weeks and never finished. at least the cicadas and their happy continuous chirping are keeping me sane - that and running into work in the morning, of course. it's so tempting to stay in the pool after the run, and just arse about until lunchtime! maybe i should try it one day, just to freak everyone out at work... on top of all the madness at work, i'm going to have to close down my uk company that was so close to being launched (was just waiting for an ok from the bank...) due to legal complications. basically, you can't have a company based and billing in the uk, and do most of your work and live outside of the uk. well, i tell a lie, actually you can, but you end up needing two accountants - one in each country, having a tonne of paperwork, and spending most of your income on tax, social security costs, and accountant fees... i was advised by a lawyer friend of ours of another, less complex way of doing it, so i'll be looking into that this weekend. it's really annoying though, because i have four completed web-work contracts waiting to be invoiced, and another one coming along soon: a fair bit of cash. it is really tempting to sod this full-time job i'm working at now (well, while i'm not writing my blog, of course!), and starting up a proper web business down here. i know i'd love it, as developing web sites and tools is what most interests me, but fincancially it's tricky. maybe when my better half gets a full-time job, then i'll consider it more seriously, but for the moment we need to have at least one sure source of income... might be going to see pink tonight in concert at juan-les-pins - just going to ring the fnac (ticket place) to see if there are any tickets left, and how much they cost.

"well, that weekend went by pretty quickly! time really does fly, when you're having fun (or just when you don't want it to...). new week, same old work. it's actually feeling a little hectic, so i reckon i'll keep this diary entry short. however, before i leave you to return to whatever it was that you were doing, i'll tell you briefly about dinner at bj's last night. just imagine the setting: le rouret, a quiet and small town halfway between the mediterranean sea and the alps, with a gorgeous view of both. bj really hit a jackpot with the place he's renting. he's paying about 1,000 euros / month for it, but for that he's got a great 200 years-old village-style rock walled house on top of one of the hills in le rouret, far from the main road, and with three decent sized floors (like 30m2 each level, approximately) all for himself. that's about twice what we're paying for our place in valbonne village, but it's easily twice as big, and twice as nice... jammy bloke emoji  hey, a nectarine! that'll do nicely for my mid-afternoon snack... and then back to work. oh, and in case you were wondering, no - i never did get round to renting a hobie cat over the weekend. but where there's a will, there's a way, right? one of the weekends, it will be mine. oh yes, it will be mine (for an hour or two)...

"part four: a curious riddle the suite itself was very nice, and easy enough to traverse. a bed was plainly visible, as well as a loveseat, coffee table, and television. an office area consisted of a small glass table and chair. the bathroom was an enormous space, with one self-illuminating mirror, toilet and shower. interestingly enough, the shower was not physically distinct--it boasted neither stall nor basin--and instead simply presented itself on one wall of the room. maureen explained to me the luxury of space in new york city, but still i insisted on knowing how the water from the shower did not end up beneath the sink. after some deliberation, i contrived a protected position on the loveseat, with my hat serving as an ad hoc waist-level buffer. i resolved not to make eye-contact with the bed until absolutely necessary. maureen joined me, fully female and now ordering drinks. was i thirsty? yes, i am fond of beer. juice, maybe, only don't add too much juice. water is best, just be sure put the scotch in first. when the room service arrived i hid behind a partition, which i now regard as particularly foolish, as it only prompted maureen to ask, ""why are you hiding behind the partition? i want you to meet someone."" i was summarily introduced to a hawaiian, if you can imagine--one of maureen's subordinates from the restaurant of the hotel. the hawaiian was a friendly-enough fellow, and not entirely unsympathetic to the chance of finding his boss alone in a room with a person of questionable income. he would return later with more drinks and a complimentary gift from the restaurant staff: a hotel hudson intimacy kit. in retrospect this hawaiian understood my predicament better than i did. neither money nor occasion have i had to purchase such a device in years.

"part three: a harrowing journey ""don't you love it, scallop?"" maureen asked me, two room keys and several elaborate lies later.

""why is there dance music in the elevator? what's that green halo around everything? why can't i see my feet?"" ""that's the ian schrager difference."" ""$400 a night so i can't see where i'm going?"" maureen laughed. ""quit cryin', rye-anne. you love it."" a wall receded before us and after several steps and some examination i satisfied the impression that we were no longer in the elevator. maureen was advancing along a narrow corridor, interminable in length, her eyes no doubt better acclimated to the overpriced gloam. despite my relative blindness i kept pace as best i could, rarely discerning a floor but rather a succession of lights suspended from either wall, not unlike the landing strip of a runway. these met me in clusters as i walked, and the intervals produced a familiar enough effect: we were in among a long arrangement of private rooms, proceeding to our own. ""christ, will you slow down,"" i gasped, anxious lest i speak too loudly and disturb, well, whatever the hell might be molting down here in middle-earth. maureen materialized and guided me by the hand, which is by far my best appendage to be led by, although i still held out hope this would not spoil the evening. ""hurry, hurry, your royal boyness,"" maureen chided, ""the last thing i need is for my boss to find me marshaling men into rooms at discount rates. my boss is an oompa loompa from the chocolate factory. he has one of the sourest temperaments known to man, even too sour to make their famous oompa loompa sour balls. he is a little man: little hands, little nasally voice, little hair, little teeny feet, little closed mind--closed shut like a little mouse trap, it is!! why, even his heart is little, but little does he care.""

"a man for all treasons: part two wartime advantage or no, i immediately made haste to apologize for a variety of personal shortcomings my date--we will call her maureen--would doubtless recognize in the coming hours. my sunglasses, for instance, were far too stylish, and i feared being mistaken for someone too eager to make a good impression. my pants, as i have already made mention, were a kind of elaborate rag suspended from my hips which i had hoped to conceal as best i could with my large hat; but i soon realized this strategy worked best in a seated position that i could not easily reproduce while walking. i apologized for my vulnerability to the sun and my constant consumption of water and hourly lavatory constraints. mercy on maureen, was woman before ever so be-pelted with regrets! ""stop doing that, will you?"" she finally told me. ""you're fine."" for some time we walked about the city, avoiding a variety of topics, and making our way to the hudson hotel (pronounced ""hudson hotel""--the article is silent). the reader may well question the wisdom in booking a hotel room on the first date, and i must confess a certain degree of trepidation regarding the matter myself. but soon i felt very selfish indeed: if soldiers can so bravely answer the call of war then surely i too can be-bed unfamiliar females. i considered the bravest souls of operation iraqi freedom--anyone under attack from the us military--and decided that i had it easy. and besides, maureen had a crazy discount. suffice it to say i have never experienced a hotel so uniquely odd and ostentatiously expensive as hudson hotel. maureen had to assure me that i would not be forcibly removed from the establishment at a moments notice, so convinced was i to be tromping beyond the privileges of my caste. ""just make sure they know you're with me,"" she explained. but this proved difficult even for maureen: when consulting a front desk co-worker about checking in, so untenable was the premise that she had reserved a room for me in her name that the general manager, a large german, was summoned to sort out the whole mess.

"rumsfeld: freedom, belgian courts, are untidy in 1998 the un general assembly voted in favor of a treaty authorizing a permanent international court for war crimes. the united states, china, and five other nations opposed the treaty, and 21 nations abstained. the treaty has been signed by more than 130 nations (including the united states), and formally came into effect in july, 2002, when the court was established. called the international criminal court and located at the hague, it may prosecute war crimes, genocide, urllink crimes of aggression , and crimes against humanity. under the g. w. bush administration, the united states opposed implementation of the treaty, out of fear that american officials or military personnel might be arrested abroad on baseless charges. in may, 2002, the united states repudiated its signing of the treaty and indicated that it would refuse to cooperate with the court; it subsequently insisted that u.s. forces used as un peacekeepers be exempted prosecution by the court.( urllink 1 ) urllink belgium indicts us with war crimes in iraq, rumsfeld mad urllink why american officials should be exempted from international law urllink us war crimes from gulf war i urllink interview with former us attorney general ramsey clark on american militarism and international law ",1
"why did we go to war? this is the best my co-workers and i can figure out: if we find weapons of mass destruction in iraq, then it will have been about weapons of mass destruction. if we don't find weapons of mass destruction in iraq, then it will have been about something else. ""we didn't lie,"" one bush official told abcnews, ""it was just a matter of emphasis."" in other words, the war will ultimately be about whatever we want it to be about, and we'll let you know once we've made up our minds. so much of this is right out of george orwell's 1984. in fact, because 1984 is so often associated with state totalitarianism, we don't usually apply it to propaganda systems in democratic societies, which are usually much more sophisticated and convincing. when the only news source in a country is government controlled, people know well enough to discount what they're hearing. this was how i always viewed orwell's oceania--a kind of clumsy, soviet-style system, holding a bludgeon over people's heads lest they fall out of line. (having re-read 1984 again recently, i think there's more to it than this, but i will leave that aside for the moment.) it's not as interesting in terms of propaganda because the propaganda isn't as good. if you want to see propaganda that people can invest themselves in, you have to look to the free societies. what's been interesting to me about the iraq war, however, is just how unsophisticated the propaganda has been. orwell's oceania had a proclivity to declare itself at war with one country one day, only to turn around and deny it the next: it had really been at war with someone else. the intellectual class--writers, editors, teachers, archivists--were assigned the task of destroying official records not keeping with current government declarations, and to rewrite history according to the new narrative. the government of oceania relied on its population being so beat-down and apathetic, and their attention span so limited, that they wouldn't remember, or wouldn't care to remember, that just yesterday they were at war with a totally different enemy. the purpose of war was simply a means to control the population, keep them afraid, and provide justification for their detainment or execution if they stepped out of line, thus becoming 'enemy combatants,' to borrow a term from our current administration and its patriot act legislation. normally i would consider our society above so crude a means of persuasion, but in the case of wmd's, it's practically right off the pages of orwell's most famous novel. our administration sends us to war because of the 'imminent threat' we face from iraq and their weapons program. that's what they sold the war on, remember, not liberating iraqis or giving a shot to the arm of middle east peace. iraq has 'tens of thousands' of tons of weapons, and so on and so forth. blair tells his people saddam could prep a warhead with bio-chem weapons in 45 minutes. most of this is never verified, who knows where this information is coming from, but people begin to accept, yes, hussein is our greatest threat. so we lay waste to the country, its communities, its infrastructure, kill a lot of people, some good, some bad, some theirs, some ours--and now we can't find any weapons. 2 months of searching and zilch. tens of thousands of tons of materials, and we can't find a goddam firecracker. now it comes out, well, the whole war wasn't really about wmd's after all. my supervisor is saying, ""i could have told you that."" of course, the war wasn't about that ! and suddenly i am surrounded by experts in the affairs of state and foreign policy, who understood this all along. are we really that apathetic and distracted not to notice that we went to war for one reason and came out of it going to war for another--any other--reason? christ almighty. stop watching the matrix and start paying attention to the matrix around you.

"on-line dating we all know that if it weren't for the internet, i wouldn't have scored a date with a woman in the last four years. some will argue that such single-minded reliance on technology for companionship is a sad testament to the alienation of the individual and the breakdown of civil society in the modern era. to these people i say: no one else has gone so far, done so much, or risen so high with so pitiful little. in the blogs to come i intend to outline some of my most objectionable forays into the world of digital dalliance. but in today's selection, i offer you my most recent exchange: from: katriles to: summerhead date: 06/17/2003 04:20pm est subject: summerhead message: hi there! i read your profile and was very impressed. i would love to speak to you if possible...... if you could email me back i would really appreciate it. have a great day and i look forward to hearing from you! from: summerhead to: katriles date: 06/17/2003 06:53pm est subject: hello katriles message: hello katriles, thank you for writing me. i was saddened to see that your profile was blank, and not a picture to be found. as i don't have any information about you i'm feeling at a loss. maybe you can provide some detail in response, no?

there shall never be another opportunity so sweet! please consider it... if you don't think it the best thing for you - then at least tell me that you will talk to me (or let me talk to you!!) about how we introduce people to one another over dinner at super restaurants... peacefully yours, kate from: summerhead to: katriles date: 06/17/2003 08:59pm est subject: 3 girls and 3 guys?

"the manufacture of consent why of course the people don't want war. .. but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. .. voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. that is easy. all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. --hermann goering, nazi leader, at the nuremberg trials ",1

"fourteen: sex well, we didn't have sex, that's for certain. the reader may ask how this can be--how, after all that has been shared so far, and with such clarity of purpose, just how can it be that intercourse did not announce itself at our chamber door, beg pardon for the delay--it had come direct from an engagement in the south bronx--and conspire to remedy the situation posthaste? it is a hard thing to make sense of, i will grant you that. many have been the evenings since when i have pondered this mystery; to my best estimate, all the component parts were in place, to say nothing of the political justification provided by the war. of course, it is all too easy too blame oneself in these things--for my rather embarrassed station in life, say--and that is why i prefer to blame my date instead. she seemed persistently in a state of not having sex with me for the entire evening, and in retrospect it strikes me as grossly inappropriate. on the other hand, when it comes to sex i am not very persuasive, not even to myself, and doubtless this contributed rather centrally to the outcome. sex is excellent in theory. unfortunately, in practice it is even better. this is a tremendous injustice when you haven't had any practice since the carter administration--doubly so when the only thing you were practicing was catholicism. i want no truck with catholicism; it is a discussion best left for another time. and what can be said of sex in this particular circumstance is pitiful little; as such perhaps the reader will grant me reprieve for the duration.

""chocolate is good,"" i reflected, and maureen nodded, smiling.

"eight after a brief interval and some anxiety over the positioning of my left arm, the phone in our suite began to ring. maureen shot up.

"seven: the burden of my affections now, it has never been a trademark of mine that i should enjoy particular mastery in beseeching the wily female to suspend better judgment in favor of gradually becoming naked in my company. (for years this woeful inadequacy, this nettlesome spectre, has haunted even the grandest of opportunities.) to this end i am usually resigned to despair from the outset; i endeavor instead to invest myself in the few small things i can affect, such as breathing through my nose instead of my mouth, maintaining an appropriate posture, and taking care not to hold hands lest mine prove unduly temperate. these are small things, hardly commensurate to the caliber of upper-class chicanery required for the american woman to remove her bra, but whose aggregate weight i like to regard as working somehow in my favor. and to their credit, they have at times afforded me the calming knowledge that all bras must eventually be removed in one context or another--of this we can be certain--and as such so too will my beloved be removing hers, even if it is several hours after our date, while brushing her teeth. for the moment, maureen has since ended our spat of patriotism in favor of an hbo movie starring jessica lange. i am watching it contentedly myself, remarking occasionally on the points i find noteworthy or humorous. it is not a very good film, i am afraid; and yet it seems to entertain nonetheless. the strangeness of our circumstances are being consumed by the familiarity of this american pastime, perhaps; and naturally there is little question as to the effects of alcohol and the steadfast approach of midnight on women and on men: maureen pulls me alongside her singlemindedly.

"obedience obedience has special meaning in the spiritual context. it refers specifically to one's relationship with god, and on the true realization of this relationship in one's daily life. this is especially the case within the sacrament of marriage. obedience is an important part of living in communion with a spouse, particularly if you hope to have them house-trained before winter. obedience does not necessarily mean a strict adherence to the laws of man--for instance, going the speed limit on the garden state parkway, or abstaining from pornography on sundays--and should never be misinterpreted as such. most everyone experiences periods of questioning in the course of their spiritual journey. a person may ask themselves, ""how can god exist, and especially under the current administration?"" this is a normal feature of a healthy spiritual life, and should not be taken as a sign of flagging obedience. there are many great people known for their deep questioning of god, such as friedrich nietzsche, fyodor dostoevsky, and vladimir lenin. lenin questioned god for the benefit of the russian peasantry, and the peasantry questioned lenin for the glory of god; finally the peasants questioned god directly for the whole convoluted affair, but it turns out god would not speak without his lawyer present. in a similar way, friedrich nietzsche made a name for himself questioning the existence of god, and this worked very much in his favor until god questioned the existence of nietzsche, ruining his vacation plans for that summer. the moral of the story is that it is all well and good to question the existence of something, just so long no one has to forfeit their deposit in a french bordello.

"the organ urllink the organ are a vancouver quintet, formed in 2001. in a short space of time, this all female ensemble has gained rapid exposure with the release of their first ep, sinking hearts; an accompanying two-song single, and a live show that has spirited them on tour with some of the most significant bands today. a critical and popular favorite, the organ write melodic and introspective music based on layered interplay between their instrumentalists--debora cohen, guitar; ashley webber, bass; shelby stocks, drums; jenny smyth, hammond organ--and the intimate and doleful lyrics of their lead singer, katie sketch. the organ's "" urllink sound "" has been commented on and debated over from the very beginning, so great is the fascination that it inspires. ""the organ's melancholy melodies are intoxicating,"" writes cyndi elliot of magnet magazine. the band is consistently compared with the best songwriters of the early 80's new-wave, writing structured songs around minimal arrangements, and creating a nuanced, textured sound that can be brooding and catchy at the same time. the best of many bands can be found here--whether it is the weaving counterpoint melodies between organ and bass; the lean, bell-like intonation of sparkling guitars; the charmed tenacity of the snare; or the suspended lamentation of sketch's cascading vocals--and much excitement is borne out of the desire to name the organ's sound in precise terms. ""the organ does it so well, it's hard to believe these kids are in their early 20's,"" writes john parish of the big takeover. ""it makes me feel better than the electronic craziness of some of those 'i love the 80's' bands, and almost as sad as i used to feel in the 1980's, and i love 'em for it."" for their own part, the band accepts the associations with an amused detachment. ""originally i was trying to do something a little more rock, like elastica,"" says sketch, ""but obviously it didn't work out that way."" the organ have played with an wide variety of contemporary bands such as interpol, hot hot heat, the walkmen, the von bondies, the soledad brothers and bratmobile; and most recently finished a tour across north america with matador's new pornographers. the band has become well-known for the somber intensity of their live performances, which they happily acknowledge as involving very little physical movement on-stage. ""that's the only way we can be,"" says sketch, ""if i paid debora a million dollars to jump up and down, she wouldn't. that's just her personality."" ""the organ's approach is classic european detachment,"" writes michael white of calgary's news and entertainment weekly, ""it creates an enveloping mood, and fully complements the music's soulful melancholy."" and perhaps it is a testament to the saliency of sketch's dark lyrical themes--which range from interpersonal relationships to politics--that the organ is so often perceived as a wholly melancholy affair. organist jenny smyth is herself caught between the band's music and its rueful subject matter: ""the organ's music sounds really happy and cheerful so i always get really shocked when people say 'your music is so sad and emotional' and i'm like really !? i think it sounds like la la la. .."" with so much attention already devoted to the organ's sound and presentation, there remains nevertheless a lasting captivation with their distinction as an all female band. ""other people tend to point it out,"" muses smyth, ""'oh, an all girl band!' and i'm like, 'i'm a girl?'"" ""i'm just playing with my friends,"" says sketch. ""we wouldn't have cared if we'd found some really great boys to play with us, but instead we found some really great girls."" still, the distinction is not without significance, as drummer shelby stocks knows first-hand: her seventh-grade band teacher took her drumsticks away and gave them to a boy, informing her that girls don't play the drums. ""there was a part of me that wanted to prove him wrong--that girls can actually play. what an idiot."" ",1
"chastity the appeal of chastity has waned considerably in the modern era. this is because chaste persons don't have sex--not even on their lunch breaks. the advantage to living chastely is that one is permitted to love indiscriminately all of humankind. this is not ordinarily possible, unless you own a king-sized bed. chastity harnesses our baser impulses and channels them into mission and duty, even when we are off the clock. there are not many people practicing chastity today. the commercial secularism of the industrial societies has all but relegated the concept an anachronism from more religious times. most chaste people do not begin that way, but rather are driven to it by husbands who regularly quote dialogue from the godfather. this is not always ideal, particularly if you don't enjoy other forms of cardiovascular exercise, like masturbation. some people, hoping to find a happy medium, instead imagine themselves making love to robert deniro, or a young marlon brando, depending on the scene. few people enjoy sleeping with luca brasi, as this accounted for half of all new chastity converts in 2002.

"on poverty for innumerable centuries, christian tradition has extolled the benefits of poverty, chastity and obedience. of these, poverty is by far the most popular today, and across all age groups. jesus taught that in the kingdom of heaven, the first will be last and the last will be first--an important thing to consider if one is to get a good seat; or, conversely, if you are going to beat the rush to the parking lot after the show. jesus also taught that the poor will inherit the earth, and clearly this is true in many places already; however i am told that the waiting list for apartments in manhattan is still rather long. jesus was not alone in placing singular emphasis on the poor. st. francis of assisi harbored such love for his ""lady poverty"" that he wedded himself to her, but suffered a sudden change of heart when his in-laws began discussing italy for retirement. the final straw came when francis predicted her father's appetite would guarantee a comfortable impoverishment for years to come. being good catholics, they would not permit a divorce, but they did sleep in separate beds through much of this period. in contemporary times, it is easy to understand the appeal of poverty for so much of the world today. poverty restricts and governs one's worldly distractions, thus allowing more fully the cultivation of the soul and spiritual pursuits. one direct advantage of poverty is that it bolsters community in an increasingly alienated world. it compels one to find the good in every unwanted corner of life. the disadvantage to poverty is that your wardrobe will suffer and you will frequently be self-conscious when leaving the unwanted corners of life to attend a wedding. unfortunately, when you are poor, just as many people will be getting married as when you are rich. this is a depressing thought, but so long as the wedding is not catholic, the occasion may be expedited, leaving you with the better part of a saturday afternoon by the time you get home.

"never shine on me through the course of the night i laid with maureen sleeping at my side. at least she was asleep; i was forever unsettled in the dark. i am not, after all, accustomed to sharing a bed with women, as doubtless you must readily accept, having ventured this far with me in our story. it is quite a different thing than sharing a bed with a younger sister on a family trip, for instance, or with another man for the sake of economy. no, to lay with a woman in this way is quite a different thing altogether. as often happens in periods of sleeplessness, i was soon beset with a myriad of considerations. there were many things to observe in the hotel room at that hour, for one thing. we had retired with the windows open--the day had been unseasonably warm--and the sheer curtains of the room had at once taken up my cause, fluttering in tacit agreement. from without came the sound automobiles and the air brake reports from city sanitation vehicles. the hudson river was however many blocks west of here; it could be seen from our window. the thought occurred to me that in my senior year of high school i would sit on the rock-face of hook mountain and stare east, across the river, at my very location now. but that was many years ago and i did not entertain the thought for very long. maureen's breathing was deep and steady. in the dark everything took on the grainy texture of old film stock. her body was perfectly ghost-like beneath one white sheet. it was indescribably lovely, as you might imagine. my body was cool, too--and this was not lost on me: how often is one granted the opportunity to observe such things about themselves? not often enough! life would be much better lived with an artificial light source accentuating only our best curves and angles. i don't believe in the sun.

"it's only divine right urllink that nobody likes philadelphia is one of the reasons i've always enjoyed coming back to it. i'm forever coming back to it, on buses and on planes, late in the evenings; and in summertime it is always storming when i arrive. secretly, it's very exciting. the streets are empty at night, warm and close, the oldest buildings are wet, and it is not unpleasant to walk alone, should you feel confident in the soundness of your route, or in the gamble one takes purposing to find a bus at some point along the way. you will find people at this hour, of course, many of them city workers, or those involved in the production and distribution of baked goods; but in all you are left spying your way without passing a single soul for many blocks. when you are as travelworn as i was last night, however, you do not walk, least of all when you have arrived at the international airport after many delays and too few meals. should you arrive at phl after midnight, there will be no train to take you to center city; not only will there be no train, there will be no attendant at the terminal information desks, there will be no attendant at the transportation information desks; there is only the unflagging insistence of airport signs and markers that you continue to baggage claim and ground transportation. at the philadelphia international airport, ""ground transportation"" is an extensive queue of taxis, limousine and van shuttle services, with a $20 base rate to escort your soon-to-be-shystered buttocks into center city. it shames me to think that i joined this line of hapless sheep before resolving to find the septa bus terminal for the airport--which is about as easy as finding a deadly weapon in iraq, i might add. after some anxiety relating to changing large bills for the bus fare and being uncertain as to the frequency of the runs, i was able to catch the route 108 to 69th street and transfer all the way back into the city via the subway shuttles--net gain to me $22.40 including tip. today i was able to buy milk. part of the excitement when flying into philadelphia relates to my traveling companions. when you fly to denver, it's a perfect fit: everyone is white, they wear canvas hats and sandals, the older women have long straight grey hair and deep wrinkles, they are fit and attractive. i understand the people traveling to denver just by observing them. i know what the tans are for, and the sunglasses, and the white t-shirts, and the strappy backpacks and mesh accessories and the bottled water and the books and the hats--oh, the hats! young moms and their ponytails; i'm forever falling in love with young moms and their ponytails. but you'll never make heads or tails of people traveling to philadelphia. they're either black or they're like me, unremarkable. there's no overarching selling point to define the culture of the city, so there's no particular commonality, no giant stereotype beating you on the cranium. i understand the blacks based on their families and their histories; but what the fuck are the white people thinking? there's no natural beauty here--no bristling seaport, no adjacent mountain ranges or nearby wine-tasting valleys; the humidity is high and the air is not clean, and neither are the streets. they must, like, live here or something. the warm hand of commercialism has not descended on philadelphia so singularly as denver, san francisco or seattle; as a result, none of us know what the hell we are supposed to be about. put simply, we don't know how to dress. denver has been figured out commercially, if ever the point of commercialism was to determine what people like and sell it back to them at exorbitant rates. the supermarket--nay, almost every major franchise in the city--has polished wood grain floors, an espresso bar, and some sort of ""library"" and lounge area. (the supermarket also doubles as an art gallery and a night club where live bands perform.) everything is purposely, self-consciously, unspontaneously designed to sell not just bread, but community. my growing suspicion is that it's very easy to live in a place of great physical beauty, but hard to suffer the people--unless the place also happens to be poor; unfortunately we can't all live in cuba. i say this because i live in a sweltering hole and would never be able to afford to live somewhere nice. inasmuch as this is my station, please allow me to elaborate: a beautiful place is where everyone wants to live--and that's why it takes an hour to drive into san francisco at practically any time of the day. the more people want a beautiful home secluded in the wilderness, the more their neighbors will surround them, pushing further back to get further away; meanwhile their supermarkets sell back the community that they don't want to pay for in taxes. oh the humanity! as for philadelphia, well. there is something refreshing about poverty when the alternative is being badgered by dreadlocked trust-fundafarians in the all white boulder, co--easily the acoustic guitar capital of the world--for money and cigarettes. one thing i will say about philadelphia though: it's a nice place to live, but i would never want to vacation here. that's just depressing.

"love vs. infatuation what then is the difference between love and infatuation, and will one's bank statement reflect it? is it better to admire someone from afar--say, across the street with binoculars--or would it be better to invite them over for showering? this depends on whether you have to work the next morning. for it is said that to admire someone, one need only know them in passing, whereas in love, one must share something longstanding, like bronchitis. but how can one ever know for sure? if you feel yourself light-headed with excitement and unable to be productive, it is infatuation; if your doctor prescribes antibiotics, it is love. the economy of love the economics of love are less exact. we all pay a price for love, although i understand the rates are lower at broad and spring garden streets. but don't think you can buy love like any other commodity--unless of course it is valentine's day. let's face it: love requires some level of discretionary income. if you are poor, date someone with money who will see you for who really are--earthy and uncomplicated; and avoid dating your peers, who will also see you for who you really are--a bum. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but if the beholder earns under 30k you will probably hear about it.

"the advantage to dying two days ago maureen's father died of terminal cancer. (our second date took place in philadelphia after she had relocated here to be with him during this period.) i called the house yesterday but she had just stepped out. i spoke with her youngest sister on the phone. she's engaged to be married in november; there was a hope on the part of the whole family that her father would be able to see it. maureen's told me a lot about her--about her job which routinely flies her to paris and her fiancé who's sold b-movie screenplays to hollywood. she's closer in age to myself than maureen. she's also very sweet natured and less prone to butt heads with maureen than some of the other sisters in the family (it is a big family dominated by women). i was caught off guard when she introduced herself over the phone, and when i realized there was no maureen available to speak with. awkwardly i blurted out my condolences. i wish i had spoken in a more familiar tone. while maureen's father was dying he spoke with the dead. he didn't speak with the living--for instance, someone who simply wasn't there. he specifically had conversations with people who had already died, or other people who could not be identified. some of his episodes were rife with metaphors involving trains and gates and times and unseen people, a little boy in particular, who would be helping or showing or opening or somehow involving themselves in a process which her father was preparing himself for. maureen's father was an phenomenal reader, a history buff who spent any free time in his study, surfacing occasionally for meals. he lost all interest in these things--books, newspapers, headlines--while he was dying. in a similar way his body stopped consuming calories--his weight dropped to 123lbs. gradually he let go of the things which had comprised his life to that point. on sunday maureen sent out an email; hospice said that her dad probably had two weeks to live. he died the following afternoon. maureen is lucky because she was able to be with her dad while he was dying. they talked extensively; he talked a lot about his feelings about his life, perhaps because he was a good communicator to begin with, but also because hospice-care facilitates these types of activities. someone once told me that, if we're lucky, we are born, we grow old, we get sick, and we die. that's if we are lucky, because that is what we are designed to do: part of our purpose in life is to die. there is not a lot of time to our lives, and death reminds us. this makes choosing our life immediately important. it also lends perspective to life, when we consider our preoccupation with things like conflict and war and money and reputation. large institutions--governments, corporations--don't experience mortality in the same way, so their cultures don't acknowledge it. it is easy for governments to justify war, for example, justified or not. that's because governments never die of cancer. they lose the advantage of having that perspective; they never gain that wisdom. so they persist, being consistently foolish, serving the needs of power, as all institutions naturally do. even a fool can come close enough to death to have it touch them, and force a change in perspective. that's the advantage to dying.

"the end of an affair we were riding the subway to maureen's apartment in brooklyn. maureen was wearing a crazy nylon jumpsuit and a red hat, and her shoes were strangely angular, reminding me of a carpentry tool. i'm not stylish but i didn't feel too intimidated being with her. a lot of people couldn't tell we were together. i was standing up most of the time, trying to keep a particular expression. maureen would begin speaking to me and excite the attention of everyone around us. or i would start to say something and then distract myself thinking about all the leering men and what they thought about it. i can distract myself quite easily this way. i didn't want them to think i'd just had sex all over town with this girl and that they didn't have a chance. everyone should have a *chance*, at least--even a jerk. but the worst jerks are the kind that have to smother all over their girlfriends to make everyone else feel like they don't even have a chance. i get very tired thinking about it. we did quite a bit of walking that day, even though we weren't feeling too hot. i got to see maureen's apartment and her view of the city. we bought some vegetables and ate lunch and maureen changed into these bright pink chinese slippers that looked like they had the arch-support of a wheat thin. all the kids in the neighborhood couldn't shut up about them. but they were nice about it, and it made maureen laugh. we finally sat down in this park that didn't have any grass but had a lot of dogs and joggers. there was also a utility truck that kept passing by, throwing dirt on us at every opportunity. still, it was nice to sit and talk with maureen in the waning hours of our date. when we departed brooklyn we rode over the williamsburg bridge and maureen told me about her rides to work, crossing that bridge at dawn. we both returned home that evening, and were sick for the rest of the week. maureen had bronchitis and i had sinusitis. at first we thought it was sars.

"night in the house of ellsworth philadelphia at 8 o'clock, p.m. roommate, nicholas and a gentleman caller took their departure, leaving me in possession of the ellsworth shanty. the first observation i made thereupon was, ""verily does my estomago protest for a meal."" the impulse so acute, it put me almost beside my propriety; and i counted myself most fortunate not to be entertaining, lest i should collapse forthwith in a famine-induced slumber. many were the evenings of my youth that fatigue did visit itself upon the house, calling expressly for lack of sustenance, with neither ale nor wafer to tide me till the morn; and so i greeted my condition with the weary resignation of someone for whom the familiarity of their symptoms is as marked as much by complacency as by vexation. in the south of philadelphia there exists an impressive tradition of eating, and it would be folly to think i have not pursued this nonpareil to my every advantage. there is of course the washington avenue pretzel dispensary, whose destination in transit i am often times spied for by the men and women of 9th street row, a few minutes after midnight, and whenever a dollar proves handy. the proprietor is a round man with large bundles of currency wrapped in elastic bandings which he snaps curtly should you produce any large bill. there are many nomadic packs of youth at this hour, and my crab-like compatriot recedes into the belts and furnace of his machinery until summoned for another exchange. (in a similar way, i make a hasty retreat to ellsworth; i am not by nature a person of easy talk.) there is also the italian market, which must only be attempted in the early hours, lest one be swallowed by the throng mid-day. i learned early on to prepare myself the meals i hoped to profit by in days ahead, and the market has been instrumental to this end. for instance, i have spent considerable time in the development of a type of pan-cooked battercake, which i employ to offset the shooting pains i awaken to most mornings. i have also a rice and bean compound which goes very well with bread, and a potato and cabbage mixture that was a favorite among the irish in times of prosperity. of these articles i have subsisted heartily for many years.

"on the question of mortality dying is an important part of a healthy, active lifestyle. after all, nobody wants to live forever--unless they already enjoy rent-control. and even if death is a total state of nothingness, it's still better than $700 a month for an efficiency in bella vista. dying should be a welcome part of the human experience, especially when it comes to gentrification. if your life's ambition is to die before thirty, you can save big bucks, even if you forfeit the security deposit on your apartment--and it's never too early to start thinking about retirement. man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live, but short men that live with women encounter many bosoms. some things are hard to give up, and women don't make that any easier, unless they watch dr. phil on a daily basis.

""what anti-war people were really protesting wasn't the asinine claim that iraq posed an imminent threat to the security of the planet, or the fiscal burden our children will have to bear for a bullshit war, or even the catastrophic loss of life that a us led invasion would obviously inflict on iraqis and americans alike; it was having to show up to work everyday and suffer the smug jackassery that people who have never had an independent thought in their entire life necessarily impose on their infinitely more enlightened co-workers.""

""** moore also questions the idea that bin laden was able to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks from a cave in afghanistan--the official administration claim--when the al qaeda leader is reportedly suffering serious health problems, including possible kidney and liver failure requiring dialysis; that the 9/11 hijackers were flight school students who hijacked and then flew precision attacks into the world trade center and pentagon buildings, and not perhaps military pilots trained in the saudi air force, who represent the anti-western faction of a dissolving saudi power structure, but that saudi investments in the american economy are so far reaching, and our dependency on their oil so acute, that the us government regularly forgives them their trespasses--funding and sponsoring terrorism being one of the most widely acknowledged. consider also the unflagging resistance the white house has displayed to any open inquiry into the 9/11 attacks (yesterday's post). *patrick e. tyler, ""fearing harm, bin laden kin fled from us,"" the new york times , september 30, 2001. **michael moore, ""dude, where's my country?,"" pp. 20-21 ",1

"us press as ""stenographers"" for bush war this is long but an excellent analysis relating to my entry from march 22.  urllink reuters reports that the university of maryland's center for international and security studies released a report on tuesday slamming the us press for not questioning the arguments put forward by the bush administration for war, and acting as a virtual stenographer for the white house. interestingly, susan moeller, the author of the report, argued that ""the 'inverted pyramid' style of news writing, which places the most 'important' information first, produced much greater attention to the administration's point of view on wmd issues at the expense of alternative perspectives."" i suppose she means that in an american context, whatever the president says would always go in the first paragraph, and scott ritter's comments would come several paragraphs down--even though ritter knew what he was talking about with regard to iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and bush did not. the inverted pyramid style is favored in us journalism, but is not necessarily used in other countries. french news columns often are more essayistic, and likewise arabic news. i spent a year one time mainly putting arabic-language wire reports into english and arranging them in inverted pyramid form, which is not how they arrived. while it may be appealing to journalists to try to blame the form of their writing for such lapses, however, there are many better explanations in my view. 1) the us print press is largely a capitalist press, which means you are trying to sell newspapers. (the old saw was that ""anyone can own a newspaper, all you need is a million dollars.) that makes it a reader's press, not a writer's. you have to give readers what they want, or else they won't plunk down their 50 cents. if the mood of the country is such that 85% of the people are supporting a war in iraq, challenging the need for that war could make the newspaper unpopular and its sales might plummet. advertisers could also pull their ads from an ""unpatriotic"" rag. 2) journalists thrive on access. if you anger the bush administration, then you are likely to be completely cut off from leaks. there is a strong incentive not to call bush administration officials liars, if you have to deal with them every day and hope to get more than platitudes from them. this is why paul krugman, who is in princeton and writes abstract analysis of policy that does not depend on insider sources, is such a brilliant dissector of the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the bushies. he can tell them to jump in the lake. 3) journalists are mostly generalists. they are talented at pulling information about a new subject out of the experts and putting it together coherently. i worked for a newspaper once and so know a little about how hectic their lives are, and what new challenges they face every day. but the fact is that most american journalists in the fall of 2002 had no idea what iraq was like, or what a shiite was, or the difference between an ayatollah and a grand ayatollah. they had no independent means of gauging whether iraq had a nuclear weapons program or not, and had to go by what the experts said. if you don't follow a place like iraq for thirty years, as i have, you don't have a good sense of what is plausible and what is not. then, how do you tell what an expert is? judith miller of the nyt thought ahmad chalabi looked like an expert--he was a major expatriate iraqi politician. khidir hamza, a former baathist nuclear scientist looked like an expert. i think the journalists' preference for powerful ""insiders"" as sources is a problem with the trade. in this case, scott ritter was the better source, and even he exaggerated iraqi wmd. 4) journalists are often part of the political establishment themselves. judith miller is a neocon who co-authored with the highly unreliable laura mylroie, and so was predisposed to buy the nonsense she was fed by chalabi and his contexts. (the nyt seems to have a fair number of neocons on its staff, for a supposedly liberal newspaper). 5) journalism does not practice, or sometimes sufficiently respect, peer review. as editor of the international journal of middle east studies for cambridge university press, when i receive an article on iraq i send it out to five or so of the major experts on iraq in universities. if they all come back and say it is weak in evidence and argument, i don't publish it. this way of proceeding ensures that articles in my journal are solid. there is no time to referee newspaper articles, though some national magazines, like the nation, do excellent fact checking. we can contrast academic peer review to the practice at think tanks. the american enterprise institute just publishes the book, without peer review. it publishes books that push or support policies to which the think tank is dedicated. this is why silly books like those of mylroie or khidir hamza can see print, and sometimes even sell well. some journalists do not know the difference between a solid book by peter sluglett on iraq, published by a major academic press, and some screed put out of a washington think tank by someone who does not know arabic and has never been in an archive. (i hasten to add that there are lots of real intellectuals in the ranks of journalists, and there are even many former academics, who know these distinctions all too well, but i believe they are a minority). lee bollinger at columbia university is thinking seriously about how this sort of problem could be solved by tinkering with the degree program in journalism there. i have to say that often when i watch television or read the mainstream press, and i see this parade of self-proclaimed ""experts"" who say the damnedest things, i feel like alice in wonderland. no such shoddy rhetoric or posturing could be gotten away with in my department, but here are people who make literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from peddling unsound information. the rise of expert and journalistic blogging, and the way it is interacting with professional journalism, may well change these dynamics a bit. blogging needn't be a capitalist enterprise, and where it is not, it can afford to be more writerly. it can tell readers things at some length that are too complex or controversial for the print media. it can allow voices to be heard that contradict whoever the white house spokesman is that year. it should not be overestimated as a force for change. it is still a relatively minor phenomenon. but at the margins it may begin making a difference. -- urllink juan cole at 3/10/2004 07:16:12 am ",1

"saudi allies some of the administration's actions have been so strange that those who reported them were initially accused of being nutty conspiracy theorists. for example, what are we to make of the post-9/11 saudi airlift? just days after the attack, at a time when private air travel was banned, the administration gave special clearance to flights that gathered up saudi nationals, including a number of members of the bin laden family, who were in the u.s. at the time. these saudis were then allowed to leave the country, after at best cursory interviews with the f.b.i. -- urllink paul krugman ",1
"excerpt of a letter to a blood-relative i just read an article in the new york times that claimed sedentary lifestyles to be a leading cause of death in the us--just behind smoking. it's really important to be active; i think it's a shame that the need is not better addressed in our society, along with countless other human needs like meaningful work, scheduling flexibility, or just more free time generally. if you've ever heard of the israeli ""kibbutz""-style of work (basically a communal system), necessary labor and manual tasks are distributed within the community, so that no matter what your professional specialty may be, everyone gets a turn doing these more physical, labor oriented tasks. anyway, quite a bit different from what we're used to in the states--although i can't see how we especially benefit from unemployment on one end and the stress-related health problems of working 60 hours a week on the other. the necessary tasks of any community can be distributed sensibly; if everyone has work then no-one works too much. it has similar applications for technology, which can be used either to produce in order to provide (people work less and benefit more), or to produce in order to profit (people are replaced by automation in the name of ""productivity""). anyway, just some thoughts on the way our economic system meets our needs as people--or doesn't, as i am inclined to think--including our need for integrated active lifestyles. the irony is that educated professionals are among those with the least time for exercise.

"10 i was too tired to tell about the feminist argument anyway. it was practically two in the morning, and i couldn't stop yawning. the place was winding down. a lot of the girls had stopped dancing and were socializing instead. my friend was trying to locate the korean stripper on account that she had disappeared. instead, he found this other girl he was already friendly with named money. money had been holding his ornamental scarf when we came back. she wasn't very korean--she was italian--but there was no point arguing about it. that korean girl had fled like a refugee, and the place was closing. despite her unfortunate moniker, money didn't know the exchange rate either--and so descended the hand of bitter reluctance upon my wallet. the going rate, money said, was ten american dollars for the duration of one song.  every fiber of my feminist being grew suddenly taut--and i don't mean that in a good way. while the kids were out i enjoyed a very brief opportunity to reflect on my experience that evening. i was still very critical about the stripping enterprise. i can't help it. women should not have to take off their clothes for money--least of all at drafty warehouse spaces along i-95. women should take off their clothes for free, at 1210 ellsworth street, philadelphia, pa. 19147. the road to equality is long--particularly if you are traveling from northern new jersey--but well worth the reward. real intimacy begins where the conspicuous stain of monetary wealth will never be detected--i live on the third floor, to the rear.

"2 i'm really pretty lousy on the whole war thing. i know i've got the wrong attitude, but i don't care. first of all, war is dangerous. people get killed doing that shit. look at iraq. it's like a war over there. the administration calls it a 'robust insurgency.' either way, dick cheney doesn't need me running around with rifle, getting shot at for halliburton. actually, that's exactly what he needs. checks from halliburton don't write themselves, after all. my question is: what do i have in common with dick cheney? this guy made over a million dollars last year, and he wants to me to run into falluja with a rifle? i would have more in common with the people trying to kill me--and by that i don't mean dick cheney. mcdonald's has changed dramatically since the end of major combat operations in iraq. for one thing, there is no two-cheeseburger extra-value meal anymore. it's just not there. now a number two is a quarter-pounder with cheese. a number three is a double-cheeseburger. they don't have the skimpy cheeseburgers with the onion shavings and the one slice of pickle anymore. they all have tomatoes and lettuce and all these vegetables on them like you're at wendy's. i guess it's part of the whole ""healthy"" mcdonald's scam--like the elimination of the ""super-size"" option (because it's too much for people to resist an unhealthy bargain when they see one). in a word, lame. the other thing that struck me was the cost. these new meals are all the same price--$4.19, with a tax that puts them around $4.50. that's outrageous for a meal which won't even reach the 2000 calorie threshold like the old super-size deals would. i never ate the supersize meals because my stomach is exceedingly small. (think of the ratio of time bush has spent acting as president vs. time spent clearing brush on his ranch. that small.) but that's not the point. i used to be able to eat an affordably priced two cheeseburgers with fries and not experience hunger for 36 hours. the new, healthy mcdonald's did not yield a similar value, as we will soon see.

"spectre of colin powell's blackness haunts cable news circuit might secretary powell's conscience be the sword on which the bush administration falls? from urllink juan cole/informed comment : by now most persons with a television and an interest in us affairs will have seen the bizarre scene in which deputy press secretary emily miller, an aide to colin powell, attempted to pull him off camera and stop him from answering a question put by tim russert of meet the press. what is bizarre is that she actually tried to lie to powell and convince him that russert had finished the interview. if i were powell, i'd try to find out for whom she is really working. when powell told her to get out of the way and came back on camera, he made a startling admission, in bold, below. mr. russert: thank you very much, sir. in february of 2003, you put your enormous personal reputation on the line before the united nations and said that you had solid sources for the case against saddam hussein. it now appears that an agent called ""curve ball"" had misled the cia by suggesting that saddam had trucks and trains that were delivering biological chemical weapons. how concerned are you that some of the information you shared with the world is now inaccurate and discredited? secretary powell: i'm very concerned. when i made that presentation in february 2003, it was based on the best information that the central intelligence agency made available to me. we studied it carefully. we looked at the sourcing and the case of the mobile trucks and trains. there was multiple sourcing for that. unfortunately, that multiple sourcing over time has turned out to be not accurate, and so i'm deeply disappointed. but i'm also comfortable that at the time that i made the presentation it reflected the collective judgment, the sound judgment, of the intelligence community, but it turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and, in some cases, deliberately misleading.  and for that i'm disappointed, and i regret it. powell for the first time has gone beyond admitting that the intel on iraq wmd was inaccurate to calling some of it deliberately misleading. if it was deliberately misleading, however, that implies that someone deliberately misled. that is, there are human actors with intentions. if a government official deliberately misled powell on this matter, that is clearly a crime that should be prosecuted. so, will the other shoe now drop? is powell laying the groundwork for an impeachment of douglas feith or paul wolfowitz?

"remembering reagan's racism one of my black colleagues called ronald reagan a racist today. normally i reserve that term for special people--like jesse helms or strom thurmond--who seem to embrace the philosophy in public ways. because racism is so much a part of american culture and history, it's also a part of all americans--if not in who we are, then certainly in how we behave. if you presume a certain amount of latent racism in every american, then the term ""racist"" can be meaningfully preserved for only the most special of individuals. having failed to review the reagan record, i initially lumped the great communicator in with the rest of us--well, very broadly, anyway. within the spectrum of racially-conditioned america, there are those who work to confront racism, and there are those who do nothing. at best, i thought, mr. reagan--white, male, wealthy, republican--did nothing. as i told my co-workers when the debate began, ""i don't know if i would call him racist. i would say he didn't care."" then my co-worker, ""abe""--a liberian emigre--ran down the record. first of all, reagan initially opposed the creation of a martin luther king, jr. holiday, calling the civil rights leader a ""trouble-maker."" i personally did not know this. another black co-worker, greg, asked abe how this made reagan a racist. abe told him it was ""clear as day."" this was not a satisfactory response for greg. i sensed abe missed the sincerity of greg's interest, misinterpreting it as a dismissal, so i tried to explain why abe had a strong argument, since martin luther king, jr. has come to personify for most americans the goals and achievements of the civil rights movement. for ronald reagan to dismiss this as ""trouble-making"" indicated to me that he either opposed the goals of the civil rights movement--making him a very special kind of racist--or he simply didn't understand their significance, being completely insulated from the black american experience his entire life. i still felt myself leaning towards the latter, wanting to give the newly corpsified president the benefit of the doubt before branding him a racist. i repeated my opinion of the former president not caring enough about black people to understand their history. ""i don't know,"" greg told me. ""he sounds pretty racist."" the second point abe articulated in the case against reagan related to his dealings with the very racist south african government in the 1980's, and its program of racial segregation--apartheid. i'm telling you these goddam jim lehrer tributes to ronald reagan can really fuck with your head: i had completely forgotten about apartheid. anyway, if hating martin luther king, jr., isn't enough, supporting a blatantly racist government and refusing to participate in its international embargo should tell you something about ronald reagan's opinion of colored people. so there you have it. ronald reagan, a very special racist. who knew? a comprehensive analysis of reagan's special brand of racism can be explored in this urllink msnbc article.

"kerry and the policy of pre-emption correspondence with a co-worker dear abraham, i wanted to say something about the ap article you forwarded: urllink democratic presidential candidate john kerry said he would be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against terrorists if he had adequate intelligence of a threat. this is actually the opposite of the bush doctrine, which reserved the right to launch a pre-emptive strike against terrorists with no intelligence or proof of a threat whatsoever; and not simply a strike--a full-scale invasion and occupation. and not against terrorists, either. apparently they were all in iran. remember, the problem isn't the policy of pre-emption. pre-emption has a meaning roughly approximating what kerry describes, as laid out by the un charter. if someone is going to attack you, and you can prove it, then you can use force pre-emptively to stop the attack. of course, it doesn't say anything about taking over other countries. it says you are permitted to use an amount of force proportional to the threat, etc. and, as always, the burden of proof is on the people advocating use of force. anyway, what is wrongly being called bush's ""pre-emption"" policy is not pre-emption at all but rather a doctrine of global dominance as laid out by the neo-cons in the national security strategy of 2002. in effect, the us has the right to maintain global dominance by force against any threat, perceived, imagined, or otherwise, in order to destroy the challenge before it becomes reality. that's not pre-emption. that's unprovoked aggression, in the name of us interests. do neo-liberals tend towards militarism in solving world problems? yes. but that doesn't make them the same as neo-conservatives, per se. yours, ryan ",1

"the enlightenment tradition from urllink ""notes on anarchism"" with the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order. in fact, on the very same assumptions that led classical liberalism to oppose the intervention of the state in social life, capitalist social relations are also intolerable. - noam chomsky the idea here is that if you recognize government as a form of centralized authority, and you accept that centralized power is dangerous, then it stands to reason that you will view other forms of concentrated power as dangerous, also. in other words, even someone like adam smith, who is credited as the founder of free-market capitalism, based his vision on a pre-industrial world: it presupposed a relative equality of property within the society, including productive property, meaning the resources and tools used to produce--land and livestock for farming, for example. (chomsky often notes that contemporary students of smith never read the chapters in ""wealth of nations"" where smith specifically warns against high concentrations of economic power.) modern-day conservatives, if they are honest, will acknowledge the danger of concentrated power in any form, since their (otherwise legitimate) critique of government is based on it. so, ironically, conservatism is one of the best arguments against the type of system that republicans currently represent.

"classical liberalism from urllink the ejournal website q: prof. chomsky, you have said in the past that you respect ""conservatism"" and that there are many true ""conservatives"" who oppose what the bush administration is doing. i want to ask is there such a thing as classical conservatism and how different is that conservatism from the alleged conservatism practiced by the likes of thatcher, reagan, bush 1, brian mulroney and bush 2? a: if by ""conservatism"" one means ""classical liberalism"" (a traditional conception), then, yes, i think there is much there that deserves respect. personally, i agree with rudolf rocker (and others) that classical liberal ideals were destroyed by capitalism, and that resurrecting them is a step towards advancing towards libertarian socialism (anarchism, in one sense of that term). if by ""conservatives"" one means those who at least approach these ideals in some way--e.g., by opposing the resort to state violence in the interests of pathological creations of state power such as corporations--then, yes, i think there is a lot to respect in these circles as well. but if by ""conservative"" one means radical statist reactionaries of the reaganite-thatcher-bushite type, that's a wholly different matter. they simply defame the honorable term ""conservative""--which is not to say that i would personally align myself with genuine conservatives, though (again speaking personally) i do respect them.

"someone passed away today... katrina villaroman was reported dead early this morning. i don't know her personally but i see her around. even if i'm not her friend, i feel kinda sad for her death. first, she was a batchmate of ours. second, she was a good person[according to many]. lastly, it was a shame she didn't even make it to the graduation. it's kinda creepy how the things happening in school are giving way to this event. i first ""vibed"" it when jonela brought her rosary by mere coincidence. turns out we were going to pray the rosary that day. then an article in the magazine which was to fill one page got lost. it kinda made way for out tribute to katrina. maybe it was...meant to be. it makes you realize how short life is when someone almost close to you passes away. i heard from mara it was a hit and run case for katrina. i wonder if anyone would stop for me if they hit me. i realized that i really do have to be careful because i could die anytime. but, hey, it was [please katrina don't haunt me for this] kinda her and her friends fault. according to the story they were sneaking out with another excuse so they could get their parents' permission. and they only had their driver's supervision. makes you think, everyone's responsible for their time. man, i almost asked daryl what she would think if i died. i didn't ask anymore because[many says] when i say it, it might actually happen. i wonder what hell is like? i'll probably go there anyway. maybe it's like our living world. they say hell is chaotic. i think our world would be much more chatic than hell so if that's the case, yeah, i'd rather be in hell.. bahala na!

""i feel so special"" because you are... it's almost been a day since i read his last message and i still feel this weakening adrenaline running through my veins. i feel so good to gain a friend and, at the same time, realize that love is sweeter the second time around. it's been five months since i last saw him and yet, there we were, talking as if we knew each other well. i know it's wrong but should i stop it? hell no! could it be that mariah carey's ""butterfly"" says the truth? [that if something is meant to be, it will come back.] i also have this strong feeling that we'll see each other again. in a few years, are plans[which, i think, are mostly jokes] may be fulfilled. it's a scary thought to fall in love again after what i've been through. it could be dangerous, painful and simply ""nonsense"". but as they say ""it's better to have loved than to never have loved at all. bahala na...

"i can't belive what i got myself into this time........ well, needless to say, i got caught..again. what's new? turns out, mommy's bitching about my picture with jammi lead to tito cocoy's berserk mode. he went mad exactly like the last time. this time it was worst, my bro was there. whatever. so i don't have anyone to team up with at home. it happened before and i didn't die. i could do this. bad thing is, my bro isn't talking to me. i don't know why but i'm really worried. goddammit! i told daryl about my ""i love you"" incident with jammi. what the hell, she's my best friend anyway..i think.... i can't believe that kuya mico and paula are a couple. this is some news! well, the other day, i said good-bye to jammi. i even shared my ""one year quarantine"" plan with him. and i told him i do love him, unfortunately, over the net. later that night, he called me. and i told him that things weren't so bad after all. he didn't have to wait for a year [yes!] and i whispered the most awaited and stupidest thing i couldever blurt out, ""i love you, baby"". but, hey, it was worth it. we still haven't talked and i miss him. i'm still waiting for my folks to call. i'm wondering how they'd react to this.

"what do you say when someone you like says, ""i'm falling for you."" me? i just freak out....heheh.. there has been this sparky attraction between jammi and i since the beginning but we just take our relationship easy. we're something like ""more than friends but not quite lovers"" [is that right?] but yesterday, that changed...big time. jammi and i were talking about something then our conversation landed on...[ehem, ehem]...touching ourselves. he approached it very cautiously and respectfully. anyway, he asked me something i didn't understand well [why does he have to be so smart?] and then we got cut off. when we chatted again, we both agreed we'd be open to those topics since neither of see any point why we shouldn't. i also admitted being a bit offended by his question earlier. that's when we had fun with the ym emoticons. we were trying to figure out which emoticon suited us. that was fun.... then we got into speaking deep tagalog for fun. i was so giddy because i always found old romantic things very...um...romantic. here's what kept me up all night with a hanger-wide smile plastered across my face: he said he wanted to tell me something but i shouldn't freak out. so i said it was okay since i thought it was something about him. but it was about us...about me...he said: ""i'm falling for you"" needless to say, i freaked out. i wasn't able to reply for a while. too much mixed emotions surged through my bones too quickly i lost myself. there was joy, relief, shock [a lot of that], doubt and giddiness. being a total klutz, i asked him if he was sure. the answer i got was beyond perfect. he said he liked me more and more each day. something like that. he asked if i didn't want him to, again, being a klutz, i said i did. but there are circumstances. what i meant was i don't have total freedom to love. gosh, at that time, nothing else mattered....just the moment itself...... later, he asked me if i wanted to meet his ex. jammi explained that mariz, his ex, became conceited after their break-up. she was telling all her friends that jammi wanted her back and was courting her. it came to me, maybe mariz got so hung up on jammi's tlc that she's doing these stuff because she missed him. anyway, jammi wanted to teach her a lesson and he wanted me to do him a favor. i did, i pretended to be his girlfriend! i was wishing with all my might that that would someday be true. in the conference where i met mariz, jammi and i were calling each other ""hon"" and ""baby"". gosh, both of us were extremely giddy. only after about 3 messages from mariz, she left. after a while, i did, too. nyt nyt, jammi... and here i am..... gosh, i feel like i'm dreaming....^_^ ",0
"gosh, i feel so guilty about ranting about my own stupid life. they're right, you shouldn't comlain about your problems because someone out there will always have a bigger problem than you...or something. i can't believe i've been whining for so long when i should be glad that heaven, hell and earth are fallingdown on me like a landslide. i'm lucky both my parents are my real parents. i'm glad i don't have an ex who will try out suicide. i'm thankful i don't live in front of a pool with out-of-tune people sing all day long. i'm thankful i have someone with me. i read the cosmo mag[i duno if i'm allowed to.] a few hours ago and it started sinking to me that men really do talk. it was said there that girls should let the guys talk to attract them or something. i know jammi isn't the ""following the herd"" type so i don't know if i attract him by letting him do most of the talking. but, i guess there's a ""deeper"" meaning to it. i mean, when i talk to daryl, it's always me talking. and when i realized that i'm learning to listen because of my chats with jammi, i started feeling kind of guilty for being so darn talkative. that should be one of the things i should change in high school. i remember mae giving me this folder with proverb-like stuff and in front was written, ""to talk is a skill, to listen is an art"". wow, hit me pretty hard. i also read the good housekeeping mag and it was said there that teens tend to lose themselves when they're in love. i guess, it's the same for me. i haven't talked long to my friends lately because i'm always in the internet. is it really my fault? am i obligated to call them? i know i should be doing it out of the goodness of my heart, but the problem is, there's no more goodness left in me. heehee...... my life was never ""almost perfect""... at least from what i see and feel. my classmates always said i was the girl nearest to perfection. i have a good family, i excel in school, i'm pretty, i can handle situations and i am loved by all. i feel like throwing up whenever they assume i'm living a perfectly happy life. because i'd rather live a life where i struggle in school, my family's broken into pieces, i look ordinary and where nothing much is expected of me. sure, every once in a while, i'd love my life and never wish to trade it with someone else's. but the problem is, when i get used to the feeling of perfection, i get bored with it. meaning, i'm bored with my own life. i hated it when i easily understood stuff in school. i was supposed to be challened in there but instead, i'm only fed with information i already know or lessons as easy as addition. im not really loved by all, no one is. by many, maybe, but definitely not all. when i fight with daryl, obviously, she doesn't love me. when i'm being a total klutz, i bet my brother wishes i was never born. sure, my parents love me, my friends, my teachers, my family do. but it hits me, do they love me or are they only obligated to do so. maybe loving is an obligation so maybe at some point it's not spontaineous. but if love is everybody's obligation then i guess it's not really a matter of discusiion anymore.honestly, i can't handle situations. they think i do because i don't break out and cry...in front of them. i do. when work at the theresian mag was getting out of hand, i would run to the restroom and have a long nervous breakdown. whoever said crying doesn't help is wrong. it does, a lot. it helps you relax and you tend to think more clearly when you do. i don't know about anyone else but crying works for me. sometimes i wish i was in a different school. so then, i can start over. i could lay low, i could build a new laid-back personality. but that would be running away and leaving the things i started undone. sometimes i wish my own parents would only let me be myself. i wish they would tell me to do my best and aim for perfection. i wish they'd be satisfied with an ordinary daughter. when i grow up, i don't want to be put up in a high position right after i graduate. i want to work hard to attain that ""greatness"". then i'd feel more satisfied and i would know i really worked hard for it. sure, i may have worked hard for it in college, but then it would be unfair that i only had to work hard in a protected environment. i wonder if my parents would just throw me out into the real world. i would like that. i would learn by experience. i would learn by example. i would learn on my own. heheh, that's a lot!

"it's raining so hard today. it's cold and gloomy... kinda matches my feelings. *** yesterday, i had fun online even when jammi wasn't there. i hung out at thebeginners chatroom in mirc and met this romanian guy who taught me so many stuff about mirc. he wasn't the only person who had been helpful to me, but no one was as helpful as he was. he even taught me a couple of romanian phrases. his name's alexandru. it sounded really romantic. i guess even in simple means, the world is united. i mean, people from different countries get along in chatrooms, they even help each other out. maybe it's just the political shit that's making it hard for the countries to get along. and what is with the racial discrimination? like it helps people live better lives. it only makes the world a more chaotic place to live in.

"i saw paula today. she visited again and we got into the boyfriend talking again. man, i missed jammi so much i actually ended up calling jp[oh my god!]. but, hey, it's cool. i don't care so much about him anymore. he said he got kicked out of his old school and he repeated. he's single because tin broke up with him[about time, girlalu!] and he's getting along with his classmates. i'm happy for him. *** we had our first palihan today. it was so much fun especially with sir atengco facilitating it. plus, i got to see sir ralph all day long. man, that was fun. in the morning, we played several games. it was so tiring but it was really lively with all the cheers and stuff. then after that, we had a presentation and our section presented in puppetry from. we did a midget show of what happened last time in gawad kalinga. it was fun plus i was the one who wrote the script so i'm pretty cool[heehee]. then in the afternoon, we had a major orientation of palihan. then a prayer service. it was when i got to touch daryl. man, i'm starting feel numb towards her. what difference does it make? i don't care... *** man, i miss jammi so much...

"turns out that ms. balonkita isn't so bad, considering the lecture we had this afternoon. she taught us all about the general and specific categories of personality. i found out that most of the time, i'm an extrovert. i love being with people and enjoying their company. i always stop everything i do just to be able to talk to some person who wanna talk to me. i welcome interruptions [except when i'm studying ""seriously""]. but, of course, it's normal that i have an introvert side, too. when i'm in a bad mood, i usually drive people away and wanna be so alone. i also found out that i'm a feeling type of person. i'm sensitive to others' feelings [most of the time] and i always wanna please everybody in fear of hurting them. i'm sympathetic and i'm always available for advices. but i can get a bit analytical and thinking type-ish sometimes. there were times when i was already hurting someone without my knowledge. ms. balonkita said it was normal for us to be a mixture of the different types since an individual isn't a constant matter... or something. i also realized i really am a romantic type. i always see the better side of things and i always feel like smiling because the world, to me, is heaven. *** i can't believe sir ralph knows i like him. curse those girls in front for being so damn loud. i can't believe i like him so much that i would fix up everytime he passed by and i would always turn to look when he's passing by... on the other building. i love those periods before lunch when he would come down from the faculty room to buy his lunch. he look especially cute today because he was wearing a shirt instead of a polo. damn it....

"is it possible to love something you regret?? up to now, i can't believe that jammi and i are no longer a couple. we're just friends, no more lambing, no more ""baby"", no more [possible] future guarantees for my love life [e.g. a good boyfriend, a potetial husband, maybe even a father...maybe]. no more...but i'm sure in my part that i still love him but i can't as i did before. so i'll keep that to myself even if it means being unhappy forever. suddenly i realized that i ruined my onw life. the best things in my life have come and my ""too good to be true"" bullshit kicked in and ruined everything. man, i am beautiful but i'm utterly stupid. i mean, what was with me? i kept on telling someone i don't want to let go of to let go of me. [dammit! i can't keep blogging this out!] last night, i was too happy to mind that i had a really bad migraine. why? jammi and i talked! first it was through chat. he was really friendly. i told him a lot of things and he even wanted me to be a writer because he said i was incarnated to write. i was flattered because no one has really appreciated me that much for just a friend. then before i knew it, he called me up. we were still open and close but with ""no strings attached"". there were some parts in our conversation that mad me feel like taking him back. one was when he asked me if i missed him. the other was when i told him how much high school sucked but my bro said it was a blast. he told me the probable reason he enjoyed it was because he got laid[heehee]. he said i should get laid to enjoy high school. i got all laughy and told him i didn't have anyone to trust nough to sleep with. then he said. ""me. it's not like you can't trust me anymore. wala daw. we got a little horny in the end and fortunately and unfortunately, our cordless ran out of batt. if it didn't, i wonder what would happened.

"it hurts to realize that in exchange for the supposedly best days of my life, i have to give up something, some moments. gone are the times when i could write poems in class, gone are the days when i could miss doing my homeworks, gone are the days when i hang out with daryl, gone are the days when i could be as naive and ignorant as i want, gone are the days i have with jammi. this is so hard. i feel so sad and helpless. it's like i'm having some kind of culture shock. i don't think i'm ready to take in the high school culture, it's all too complicated, too hurried, too much. i'm not saying i hate it but i'm weak, i get scared easily. i'm scared of the changes happening. i don't want to let go of the things i enjoy. i know some greater things will soon replace them but nothing beats the original, right? just yesterday, i was talking to kuya mico through chat and we got into the talking. i started telling him how much my life sucks.. well, just a part. he said it was really like that at first but soon it would get better. i'm glad i'm not alone, i'm not the only person who thinks the line, ""high school days are the best days of your lives"" is bullshit. hey, i know i'm not the only one ith this problem but this is me. i pay more attention to myself than i do to others. i also told him i'm missing a lot of people. actually, i realized what i really felt about my parents. i do miss them but i'm also angry at them. they missed the most important events in my life and they should face the reality that they can never take those back. my elementary graduation will never happen again. i would never be confirmed again. they will never be able to attend a parent-daughter bonding session ever again. of course, they won't be able to attend my high school graduation either. but i really can't blame them. it's inevitable, they're working for ""better opportunities""... better opportunities my ass. why can't things stay as they were? that was such a stupid question. but still, can't we just change physically? why do things happen when you don't want them to? i feel so strongly about these things. it's been a long time since i cried because of the things i think of. i usually cry when i'm so tired or so frustrated of the things happening, not the thing i think of. when i was talking to kuya mico, i was so teary that i couldn't see the keyboard anymore. i was sad, so alone, so hurt. but at one point, i felt so pathetic. i mean, i shouldn't be crying, other people have worse lives than mine and i have people who care for me. and i know very well that the last thing i want to do is pity myself. it will only make me a lot more pathetic than i already am. it won't help and i'll only feel more helpless. but, i'm a girl and [not being a sexist or anything] girls are touchy-feely and all emotional. i don't care, crying de-stresses me. *** it's so hard with jammi. i haven't been able to talk to him for a week now... i mean, an hour conversation. i did call him a couple of days ago but his mom was home so he had to go. then, we chatted a bit last night but he was grounded. god, i miss him so much that i get all teary when i think of him. it's like i'm falling even deeper but i want to fall out it. i can't deal with everyday life worrying like hell for a person whom i can't even talk to. but i want to be strong. i've pressed the restart button of my life and i command my soul to get a grip and be strong. i don't want to be like who i was... helpless coward me. i don't want to bail out on something just because it's hard. i chose this so i should face it. it's just that i don't think this is working out. maybe it's true i'm too young for this. we're both a bit too busy for each other. kuya mico told me that jammi has priorities and studies is one of them. i don't want to bother him in that. and besides, jammi is a guy so of course he would want girls. i don't want to limit him to a girl he can't even see. honestly, he's just wasting his time. maybe i should break up with him. not really break up since we were never a couple in the first place. maybe we should just be friends...seriously. i would never want to hurt him but pursuing this kind of connection will be more painful. but that will be making me a bitch to his friends...even to him. but hey, he said it himself, if they don't like you screw them. besides, i would be doing it for a good reason... for both our sakes. *** i'm too afected by jammi that when monique called last night, i could get enough happiness to talk to her in a happy voice. i couldn't even fake it. when she asked what was my problem, i couldn't help get all teary again whe i told her about jammi and how much i miss him. *** i'm a mess...

"the first day of the schoolyear is almost over. finally, the anxiety and nervousness has passed. now i am officially a freshie. the day started with me and my headache. i've had very little sleep last night because of the nerve-wrecking thoughts of high school. then, the next thing i know, it was already the welcoming rites. i can't believe i was the first one to walk on the aisle in the middle of 200 or so ladies screaming like crazy. it was kinda embarassing and thrilling at the same time. i fell really sleepy when the personnel intros began. i was awakened every minute by the juniors cheering for the teachers. man, were they happy. recess followed and i hung out with monique and ayen [daryl was absent]. when we came back, we had some unfreezing activities. i liked the second one the best because i felt confident to speak. i also liked the third. it made me realize the root of my failure: fear. fear of challenges, pressure, change..attention...? i found some of my classmates quite interesting. one of them was april, she said she was unique/her own individual but nonchalant at the same time. i found her self-description catchy. then, zari, a transferree who loves ballet and was very loud. lastly, jasmine who was unusually shy. it was like she was forcing her bangs to cover her eyes... almost her face. then we were given our sched. i spent lunch with monique and ayen. the cafeteria was jam-packed and there was no where to stay in anywhere. at one point, i felt extremely unwelcome and uncomfy in the hs department. when i used the cr that lunch, the sophomores dominating it at that time stared at me and i felt so intimidated. there was some kind of disgust and rejection in their look. creepy... after lunch, we met two of our teachers. first was mr. dela cruz. he was cute but towards the end of the meeting, i found him quite faggy... i think gay is more polite. i'm not sure if it was the way he said some things or the way he moved his arms. i dunno... our filipino didn't show up so we met our ap teacher next, ms. san andres. she's really energetic and she talked a lot [in a good way]. we weren't able to introduce ourselves because she was talking, which we liked because we were so tired of introducing ourselves. all day i was expecting jammi to come even when i told him not to. *** things i learned today: 1. you shouldn't be ashamed of growing up. 2. if people don't like you, screw them [in the words of lyle and jammi] 3. everyday is a new opportunity to change. 4. smile...^_^ ",0

"i couldn't help thinking about my chat last night with jammi. i was gonna update my blog when i noticed that he was online so i talked to him. i don't know what came over me that suddenly i was all serious and stuff. i asked him, ""hypothetically speaking, what if i became your ex or something, how would you break up with me?"". he said it depended on the reason we broke up. i told him what if we just fell out of love. he said he'll tell me, ""alex, i don't think is working out anymore. i've fallen out of it."" next thing i knew, i was feeling teary and heavy. it hurt and it wasn't true [yet..i hope not] what more if it was? then, a few minutes later, i realized why i asked him. i remember monique freaking me out when she said i should prepare myself for a break up so i won't be sulking around when it does happen. then, suddenly, i gathered enough courage to say what i've been itching to tell him. i told him he was my inspiration. then an ""i love you"" and i logged out because our computer was flipping out. i was kinda annoyed when he made lambing to me. i was serious, i'm not sure if he was. sometimes, i wish we didn't fall in love. maybe it was better if i was the only one who fell. i just realized that all relationships that end up in romance are as cliche as the golden rule. wasn't it more thrilling and exciting when we were itching to say what we felt and how each other's presence was an added suspense? wasn't it funner when i was so excited to be being in the next level than actually being on it? it's not that i don't like where we are now because i do, i just can't help falling madly in love. i always thought being so head over heels in love is much more fulfilling. i can't help holding back. all because of my bad experiences i can't indulge my self in his 'i love you's, i find it so hard to trust him so much as i trusted jp, i can't fall any deeper.... i don't know what's happening to me. probably because i deprived myself of my own freedom that i don't see the point of enjoying. maybe it's because i'm jealous because my friends have boyfriends and i know almost exactly what'll happen[face it, men will be men]. this is even worse than my insecurity. i can't say i've fallen out of love because i haven't. i don't know if it's out of love or pity. i just can't hurt jammi, it would hurt me even more. suddenly, i start thinking about the future, what if i was to go abroad? what will we do when the schoolyear starts? i can't believe sometimes, i find myself thinking of marrying him and having children with him. i had this picture in my mind with him and our kid. it was nice but sometime soon, i have to delete that from my memory. but looking at the bright side, here are 3 reasons why i say he's my inspiration: 1. the thought of him provokes the outpour of words which are my ""works"" 2. he makes my day brighter and he has the ability to put me into a bad mood 3. whenever i talk to him, i believe that there's still one person who isn't everybody else's marionette and he makes me strive to be different. i have others in mind but they won't come out. *** man, i've got issues...serious ones...

"i love the loose reality of dreams. i once had a dream i bought a baby at loblaws for like six bucks. that's right, a baby. a loblaws baby. for six bucks. bought much like those poor pet shop puppies from behind dirrty salivaed glass. i always feel sorry for those puppies, which may have been why i purchased the baby. anyway, in the dream, once i get it home, and my roommate is all oooing and awing over it, i'm like ""wtf am i going to do with a baby?!?!"" the next day, i go out and purchase a little orange tabby cat. again with the ooing the awing, and the baby is now literally just 'yesterday's news'. then, my mom and kristeye are over and i am showing them ""the new little addition to our household"" -- the cat!! and my mom is all like ""yeah, but where is the baby?"" and i'm all, ""oh, yeah, the baby"" and proceed to search for it in my natural disaster of a room and find it under like a pile of dirrty socks. (aside: yes, it is a real baby, a unnaturally tiny one at that, but it never has a name. it is literally just 'the baby') i realize that i think i've only fed the baby once since i got it, which is why it is so small. then, i try to talk kristeye into taking the baby off my hands, y'know for her new family 'n all (?!?!?!) and because it would really be unethical (?!?!!?) to *return* the baby, which is what kristeye suggests i do. the remainder of the dream is a blur of me cuddling, caressing and bragging about the tabby kitty, and trying to pawn off the baby onto different people i know. i figure either 1--this is a clear sign i'm not meant to have children, and/or 2--a foretelling of my getting a tabby pussy when i don't even particularly like kitties; my friend has a bundle and they need homes. i welcome any further interpretations.

"okay, so this is my first post on blogger.com. i did have a blog of some sort on xanga, which is another one of these webblogging tool sites. i found out about this webblog site from call for hell on techtv last night. the sad thing about that is that it was the very last call for help, which was running on techtv for six years. most of the people that watch techtv know that techtv was bought out by comcast, one of the largest cable tv providers in the country. it will be combined with comcast current video game network, g4 on may 28th. when my parents were looking to get rid of adelphia as their television provider, i suggested when they went looking for a satellite option, that they get a package with techtv included, saying it was a really cool station to have. the way that i ever knew about techtv is after i was on a trip to visit my best friend jon at suny fredonia, we stopped by another high school friend angela's room, and watch it. after the parents bought the dish network setup and the package with techtv included it soon became the channel that was on the family's living room television most evenings. with the announcement on leo leporte's blog on leoville about the fact that comcast was buying out techtv and that most of the people currently on air were to be fired, in many ways it seemed like soon we would be going back to standard broadcast stations, since most of the other channels offered on the dish are pointless. i was going to be the first one to lead the charge against the ridiculous killing of one of the best television channels out there, by one of the country's largest mega-cable-corps. besides, it seemed in a lot of ways that g4 was complete crap, and all that comcast was going to do is try to kill off something that was better all around channel that actually had good content and organization then a straight up completely console and computer game focused station. after seeing a bit of the programming being preview on techtv over the last few weeks, all hope might not be lost. the first program that impressed me was icons, which talks about the history of some of the biggest video game makers in the world. it also answered one of my longest unanswered video game questions: ""why is final fanstasy rpgs always call final fanstasy, if there is about 11 of them now?"" other programs such as filter, which has a hot asian chick on it, and arena that is pretty funny since they are doing play-by-play of unreal tournament 2004 games might be entertaining at the very least. so, i guess at the moment comcast will be spared my wrath. but with the lost of call for help, the only consolation is that the screen savers will be saved, along with x-play. gentlemen, we all know what is the best think about x-play is not their rating system but morgan webb. with all that said now, i'm off to do some more research on the differences of php, asp.net, and a good forum creating tool.

"in the beginning, what great way to start a book! i could go back to the time where there was total void; but maybe it would be better to start at, let there be light... for me the light didn't come on until i was in my thirty's, mid thirty's. i packed a few clothes and photo albums and the kids and i left california for a new life. mom and dad had moved to arkansas a few months earlier so i knew, at least, i had a place to go. the kids and i showed up at mom and dads house one week before the 4th of july in 1999 with a $500.00 car and the clothes on our backs. mom, being the control freak she is, took it upon herself to give me her car and purchase another for herself( of course i had to pay for it). then as if that wasn't enouth she also purchased a $60,000.00 double wide mobile home and parked it 40 feet from her house and told me that it was my house. don't get me wrong, i appreciate all of her help, but it would be nice if she would allow me to have a little input as to what i drive and where i live. well, as usual i just made the best of it.  (living in a 40 acre park like setting right on a river in a 3 bdr 2 bth 1500 sq ft home paying only $400.00 a month including phone, satellite tv and utilities). at this point things seemed pretty good, but don't forget mom is a controll frek! i met this guy,( looser with no job living with some mutual friends) sure he was a little younger than me, ( 9 years younger) but i loved him. well i brought him home for a weekend to spend some time with me and the kids. the following monday evening when i came home from work and found a note lying on my bed from mom!!!( insert heart pounding music) basically it said that i was not allowed to have men at my house over night; remember i am in my thirty's, but i didn't want to give up a good thing ( see above discreption of where i live) so eventually that relationship died out. now we are closer to current day activity. in february of 2004 my dad left. ( imagine that) it was kinda weird the way he left. i came home from work firday evening about 6:00pm maybe 6:30pm, changed clothes and headed to mom and dads to get my mail and play a quick game of backgammon with dad. mom was cooking dinner, i asker her where dad was and she said ""out for a walk"" ( nothing unusual). after an hour or so it statred to get dark and dad had not reutrned. ( dad is 61 has a bad heart and bad knees) i went out with a flash light and looked up and down the river and yelled out a few times. by 9pm i was back in the house and ready to call the police, but mom didn't seem as concerned. she showed me that there were papers on the desk in her room that were previously in the safe deposit box, and next to them was the check book and several of dads credit cards. instinctively, i went to dads medicine cabinet and it was empty. ther first thing out of my mount was "" dad ran away from home"". as time passed we noticed that he took blankets, we found a receipt for another camper truck and the generator was gone. mom filed a missing persons report and filed for devorice. do to a lot of legal issues, we are getting screwed ! the judge ordered mom to sell the house, then the proceeds will go to a law firm, and the law firm will pay off all the marital debt., when all is said and done mom will be lucky to break even, but as ususal she doesn't see that. (mom, by the way, tends to live in a cotton candy world where dad took care of the cars, property, payed the bills and so on ). so in a nutshell that is where we are as of today.... ",2
"i've spent the last three days exhaustively tweeking my website and my fathers networking group website. i feel as if i have finally gone insane. the littlest things in web design seem to take the longest time. sitting in front of my computer listening to radiohead for hours and hours at a time. that is my life now that i have finally quit starbucks. the idea is to go big. a year out of college i have realized a few things about things. i have spent the past year temping and then working at starbucks (which is a good company, possibly the only responsible international corporation in the world), drooling over the mild security of a tiny, but reliable weekly paycheck. meanwhile i am a year older and i have almost no new web experience. the fact is working and then coming home and working (on web shit) is too much. i need to take the risk of not having money and finally devote myself to becoming an expert and being the man at it. get to a point where i am offered jobs from outside my personal and secondary circle of friends and my fathers business friends, get to the point where i can charge a shitload of money for it, and if i fuck it up-i'm studying to be a teacher anyway so whatever. jim carrey and jewel slept in their cars. dustan hoffman and gene hackman used to sleep on their friends floors. i am only risking not going out for a few weekends. big deal. its too bad about starbucks though. i had fun there, there were health benefits and good things (the coffee was shitty though). this is why not to hate starbucks: they give part time (20hours a week) workers full health. they go into third world countries where they grow their coffee and provide free education and health services to the people who grow and harvest the coffee. if every corporation did that there wouldn't be a problem. except that bush is a shit, but thats only a four year problem (hopefully).

"i can't be happy....grrrr. i've been trying so hard today, but nevertheless, i keep crying. and each time i cry i just feel really stupid and girly. specially casue im crying bout really dumb shit. for example, today i started crying in the middle of dairy queen in front of a whole shit load of ppl cause i realized that i was busy both day and night untill next tuesday. i was then told that next tuesday would be spent getting my license, which completely pushed me over the edge. so i'm hysterical in the middle of a dq crowd that's trying to enjoy their family time and ice cream. rather pathetic eh? i guess im just so exhausted that i can't take it anymore. i desperately need one night where i can sit and do nothing, an evening where the most strenuous activity i partake in consists of painting my toenails. but instead i must be busy, constantly. at this point, im looking forward to school and finally being able to slow down and take a break. apparently tho, school is gonna be just as bad. im doing softball, and ill be doing admissions forms, and my boss wants me to continue working nights and weekends. when will it end??? and i can't sleep anymore emoji  maybe thats the worst part. when i try to sleep i just have nightmeres. i think the best rest i've gotten all week occured last night when my boyfriend was over. i completely passed out while we we're watchin a movie together. i felt really bad about it, but at the same time, he made me feel safe...i wasn't scared to sleep. i've been told several times now that i only love him cause he loves me, and for awhile i was really scared that it might be true. but there's so much more to it than that. he makes me remember how it felt to be a little kid, all curled up in my daddy's lap. nothing could touch me or hurt me, i was protected from the evils of the world. damn me! im sounding mushy again. this must be stopped immediately.

"thursday through today, east lansing had a sidewalk sale. all the businesses along grand river ave. brought out a few carts and tables, cleared their back rooms and tried to sell their garage sale quality junk at discount prices. it's time for me to get rid of my back room junk as well. 1. my job does not excite me. 2. i want a new ride. 3. i am hooked on techno. my boss will be retiring next year, his boss retiring in 2-3, and i am a strong candidate to move up both times. unless i am given better autonomy, the positions don't look all that interesting. hence, i am looking for a better position. so far, i am applying to places near milwaukee, boston and chicago. d.c. may be added. what i want is some place that i can wake up in the morning and want to go to work. i am not leaving until i find that. also on the sidewalk sale is my car, the buick grandmamobile. this has got to go to make room for my new urllink chevy colorado.  give me a few more weeks, and i will know exactly what i am getting, but i think it will be a crew cab 2wd truck in their bright metallic copper color they call sunburst orange. this is one step, the next being to get my motorcycle cert and find me a urllink nice bike.  memorial day weekend, detroit's hart plaza. urllink the world's largest free electronic music festival. i was there. i caught several acts, including kevin saunderson. leading up to that and ever since then, i have been listening to more detroit techno music, trying to find it online, on itunes, at barnes and noble, even on the streets of east lansing. the former urllink blue note cafe was great for this (that's me there, before i moved to e.l.). julie and... uh, what's-his-name, mixed music there on a pair of turntables just for fun. i'm even listening to some urllink techno now. how's this fit into the sidewalk sale? i need to clear out my current music and find more of this. just like caffeine, i am now addicted. come get my cast-offs. a halfway satisfying job with eventual upward mobility. a buick grandmamobile. music of another life. i am moving on. back inside, i am clearing room for an exciting job with real rewards, personally and socially. i am looking for more vibrant cities. i am getting a new ride. i am changing to a charging soundtrack to my life.

"i got back from erc this evening and came up to my front entrance, suddenly struck by the strong aroma of kung pao. a word about where i live, i go through the front door into a lobby area with all the mail boxes for my building, a couple of windows and the elevator and stairs. it's reasonably elegant, if spartan in decor. the wall is flat beige, large slate tile, and absolutely no adornments. not even a ficus. appearances mismatch, that's how it's been for me the last couple of days. kung pao meets empty lobby. this morning i awoke to my newly rearranged (three days ago) bedroom. with the start of summer, there is sun outside at too-early-o'clock. after already having hit the snooze bar, i awoke not feeling the best, a slight bit disoriented, hearing the guy on npr say ""it's 20 before the hour."" it takes me 16-18 minutes to drive to work and i needed to be at work by 8. i got on some clothes, deodorized, grabbed my stuff and was out the door in five minutes. i was outside, going up to my car before i realized it was 6:45. i returned missy's call yesterday. she had called sunday while i was at my parents' celebrating father's day. all monday i kept thinking of her. as i told karin monday, if she and i were geographically closer, i would date her in a second. i haven't really thought of her as someone i should date either because she or i have been in another relationship almost the entire time we've known each other. don't get me wrong, her current boyfriend is a nice enough guy. it's just ever since she said ""he's not the right guy, he's just the right guy for now, "" i've had a certain distaste for him. missy's also such a sweet person. she's even got a voice that sounds pleasantly surprised whenever i hear it. anyhow, she's fitting into her new life in the city finally and he still is a part of it. getting back to the phone call, she left me a phone message. after that, i couldn't go an hour without thinking back to it. then, after talking to her, she mentioned how she was fitting in with her peers, even going to company functions at both her job and his. those last two words brought me back down. kung pao hits the lobby. after returning, i knocked on blake's door to see if he wanted to go out for a beer. he and his better half were both watching moulin rouge while waiting for sex and the city to come on. he invited me in, so i decided to crash there for a few minutes, catch up a bit. he offered me a beer, since that's what i was coming over for, so i took him up on it. unfortunately, they weren't drinking. that makes me feel uncomfortable, drinking alone. i drank the beer, caught up with them, saw his new favorite program, then said good night and made plans to go get that beer over the weekend. still, between him watching sex and the city and my drinking without him having one too, it was that strange clash again. i'm hoping for better results tomorrow. at least i now have a small round table in my office. my boss says it looks like a coffee shop sitting next to my mini fridge and coffee machine, but i like it. maybe i'll have chinese tomorrow.

"i need a spot to spout off on things. this is it. 1. the girls around here have been getting short skirts that are about 2/3 ruffles. the skirts look stupid. 2. i am addicted to coffee. 3. damn, i need a girlfriend. if nothing else, to make the gay guys back off. 4. i need a project at home. first item. the night out skirt for the college sorority girls is now something that approximates a bedskirt. it looks stupid and, although i do appreciate the short length, does not flatter the wearer much. sorry, sorority girls, it just ain't right. my carpet is drying. i ran the carpet cleaner over most of it yesterday and the rest of it today. none of my furniture is where it belongs and all i could think of while i was doing the job both today and yesterday was coffee. specifically, a double capp while mostly reading my book out on the sidewalk in front of espresso royale cafe. erc is downtown and there are lots of people to look at from there while i get my fix. very nice setting, but not what i need when i have work to do at home and the weather is something of a phenomenon of 103% humidity yet no rain. today i did get my fix, though. while i was at erc, i ran across miranda. she was someone i almost dated between my freshman and sophomore years of college. she was going to be a senior in high school, a fact that helped me realize, no, don't go there. one of my classmates, jake, did. they were a couple starting shortly after my brief time with her at least through a few months ago. he wasn't there tonight, though. anyhow, i thought about her after seeing her there and thinking both i need a date and don't go there. if i did, it would at least get al's gay friends to believe i am straight. more on that later. i helped al move into his new house this past weekend. he's someone i met at erc a couple years ago. he got a nice place, needs a bit of work but not much. the problem is, he's not the one to do it. he has no mechanical aptitude (no, the socket wrench works the other way) and is moving in piecemeal from about 2 miles away. he's moving almost no furniture, but i doubt he'll have moved everything before 2013. nonetheless, i am a bit jealous of his house. i could use the project and i can see how to do it. the house is in good shape, but needs a new kitchen, fix a few squeaks in the hardwood floor, some new light fixtures and it's good to go. after helping al move saturday afternoon, his friends came by. al is a low key kind of guy, but his friends are not so much, and all of them there that afternoon are gay. the first to come by (i forgot his name) came to pick up the bed frame al bought at world market in his truck. his truck is a ford f150 with a construction company logo on the door, his ""barbie"" truck. on the way there, he yelled out ""breeders"" at a mixed group on the front porch (this one i got, there was an obvious couple there, straight). anyhow, the three of us went to world marked. now, i like red wine. they have a nice selection. i bought a couple of bottles they had on clearance. the wine guy claims some accountant with no knowledge of wine decided to put them on clearance. al's friend also bought a bottle of wine. we get back. two more of al's friends arrive in their purple sebring convertible. al's friend opens the bottle of wine he bought and pours it, so i figure i'll make mine available, too. to cut to the chase, i spent saturday evening drinking several glasses of red wine and a toast of champagne with four gay guys. they said i have a bit of a refined quality about me, that i need a new haircut, and as the evening at al's was winding down, i was invited to join them at spiral. i turned them down, reminding them i am straight. again. al's pickup truck driving friend gave me a ride home (all 8 blocks of it) while i sobered up to drive my car back. it's sort of a queer eye for the straight guy experience. i could go on, talk about work, but this is long enough for a first post. my carpet is still drying, but close enough to get the crap off my bed so i can sleep tonight.

"it was a short week following the 4th holiday on monday (the 5th). in spite of the short work week, i couldn't make it. i took the afternoon off. last week was also a short week. they made the 2nd one of the two floating holidays at work. that one, however, was very good. i slept in, got out just before noon for a run for about an hour, called karin and went to harper's for a beer around 1:30, then met up with al and a couple of his friends for spider-man 2 at 4:20 (he-heh, 4:20). i followed this up with going back to do packing and some critical laundry for packing for the weekend in indianapolis. last friday was fun and productive. this afternoon, i wasted away nearly all of the two hours i took off by sitting inside my house putzing on my computer. this wasn't the idea on a gorgeous friday. i did finally get out, first to quickly run into the bank and then to run. i got my usual bank teller, the enthusiastic redhead. she had on her hank cd in the back and was nodding along with the music as she processed my rebate check. i'm glad i got her, partially because i didn't bring my wallet and the other teller there always asks for my id. also because she's a cute flirt, even though she's married. aside from my hour long run and my trip to the bank, i haven't done much with my afternoon. karin had to clean the bathroom before her guests arrived, so no beer with her. i was lazy, so i didn't get to any of the major 8-5 stores. i don't even have my new car yet. my request for a program car is in limbo. even gm is lazy. they are on their summer 2 week shut-down, meaning i won't know until the week of the 19th at the earliest. damn them and their desirable new truck. next weekend, i may go down to chicago. i just decided this. i'll call missy and john and whoever else may be there. jason's engaged. congratulations. for future reference, don't send a mass e-mail for that type of thing. and don't wait ten days to send it. nonetheless, i drank two toasts to you and gina on wednesday over half priced beers with karin. good luck with the move this weekend, too. al's in puerto rico, living it up and getting away from the new house worries. have fun al. to recap, karin is having company tonight, jason is moving and trying to let people know his big news, al is in puerto rico and i am sitting here, unable to put forth a full four day work week or do anything with my afternoon off. next week is definitely chicago.

"hey folks here are a few rules of what not to do one your way to tumbling class... i just thought i would share 1.) dont drive over concrete grass. there is no excuse for it although it is good for your abs. 2.) never trust directions when it says. 1 miles it isnt. 3.) always stop at dance studios and say ""hi im a dancer gone retarded can you please help me find my way to cheer/tumbling class?"" 4.) don't show up a half hour late for your free class, it looks bad and makes you truly feel retarded. 5.) always have fun being lost for 40 minetes especially when you are getting pissed off and want to cry. 6.) be good to your car the poor thing never did anything to you and im sure concrete grass doesnt taste so good. 7.) even if your intention was to do something good for your health stop at arbys and have some class a+ junk food. i promise you will feel better after you do like 9,000,000,000 crunches emoji  so those are just some of many many rules of what not to do on you way to cheer class. so as i predicted in my first entry today hangin out with clo certainly helped my mood i hope it will last. peace and love and crabs for everyone!

so yea i had a really sucky day and i dont really know why. i was just kinda down cept for a few moments when i was with my girls and hopefully later at tumbling class i will have a good time with chloe. that should be good. i did alot of walking today i was quite surprised at how i wasnt tired at all seeing as that was the most i had walked since freshmen year...lol damn walking to school. so anyhow nothing important to say today except that im sorry to everyone i was kinda mean to this week it hasnt been a good week for me and i took it out on other people. sorry much love ,0
"ok first of all why cant we are just get along? it seems like this year has just been full of all kinds of shit and it fuckin sux freakin blue asss monkey butt if u know what i mean but seriously no one is perfect so dont expect them to be. no one is always nice in fact sometimes they are a bitch. and no one is a perfect angel sometimes they are slutty or drunk or whatever. so forgive and forget i know how it is to go and change your life because your friends are spilt. i know how it feels when someone hates you or you hate someone and it sucks sinething maybe not butt maybe ass. so anyhow i will use the x, y, and z thing cept this time y is diff cuz i can talk about myself as much as i want. y just say your sorry to x and z chances are(100% positive) they will forgive you and apologize as well. x i know your hurt but forgive y and apologize, z i know your not made you just have you opionions about how things should be done and so does y but you should all be able to think in their own ways. x and z just ask y if she would just not use your names in her profile im sure if she saw that you cared so much she might just keep using x's and z's sometimes all you have to do is ask people and they will do what you would like. y try using the letter thingy if it will cure the friendship suffering i think its worth it and i think that you might see it that way as well. i know julie and i want everyone to get along she barly sees any of us and when she does it seems like someone is mad at someone else at any given time. and i of all people should know how it feels to have her freakin friends hate eachother and talk shit on each other and it sort of sucks because no one will fuckin listen. so if everyone could all just get along i would appreciate it ok? muahs and hopefully peace and love will come your way.

"hey guys so someone told me the other day that my blog was boring. at first i was shocked and sort of sad about it but then she said you havnt added anything forever! my excuse? well i was away for a while, i have a boring life, i was sick...well those are all true and thats all well and good but the truth is that this blog really is kinda boring compared to some others...(julie!) damn they always show me up! but guess what i have some news for you! and its quite interesting...ok question how would you feel if you (by chance) meet the girlfriend of a guy you'd been hooking up with? and that they'd been going out for like a year? but you had only known this guy like 4 months? ugh! thats how i felt. a little shitty, used, pissed off, and kinda sad because i really wouldnt have expected that one. i guess it kind of showed when he had to leave the room to talk to his ""best friend"" at 4 in the morning and had his ""best friends"" picture on his computer screen. but hey i have pictures of my best friend right? haha well anyhow even though i've had numerous offers i think i will pass up someone hiring a hitman or someone breaking his knees or in my friends words ""offing"" him. lol you guys are so sweet and always cheer me up. i know that one day i will find a guy who isn'y shitty and actually likes me crazy porn hair and all...last remark ryan, of course. anyways thats just a little vent there i'm sure there will be some interesting ones coming up in the near future or at least i will find something to write about for you guys however many there are probably like five. but yes thats my current boy situation and no i am not a ""pimpette"" love always you own maddy.

"alright the first time i started this post, my computer flipped out and restarted itself so everything died. if it does it again, its getting shot in the face. that's a warning to you, you piece of crap pile of metal and plastic they call technology. this whole me and nick not hanging out thing is getting slightly retarded. sort of like this blog. yesterday we didn't hang out because i got home way later than expected, and now today his parents have dragged him off to the mall. it sucks. hardcore. oh well. friday night was movie night at amy's. we had a whole bunch of movies picked out to watch and courtney was supposed to come join us but she had to stay home and babysit her brothers. so me and amy made some jello jigglers and watched half of ""the shining"" before falling asleep. it wasn't the original jack nicholson version of ""the shining."" it was the remake from the 90's, where the guy uses a croquet mallet instead of an ax. it was sort of funny actually. except for that whole bunny topiary thing. that was friggin creepy. i would be scared shitless if a bush shaped like a bunny came after me. i really would. saturday, we woke up way to early at like 7 am. then we had waffles and finished watching the movie, then we watched the muppet movie. then we got ready to go shopping and i made my hair all gross and curly and wore weird shiny bluish greenish eyeshadow. it was awesome. i looked all girly and whatnot. then i went through amy's closet and found a random belt and her old school euclid school t-shirt. then we found her old euclid school sweatshirt from when she was in like kindergarten that doesn't fit her anymore but of course fits tiny danielle. so w00t, i have this awesome sweatshirt now. later on, we were sitting downstairs and listening to random ska music and shitty hip hop waiting for her mom to come home from work, when the doorbell rings. its my sister steve. i told her to go home. so she got back in the car where my mom was waiting and i followed her and asked why they were there and they said they didn't know so they left. it was strange. finally amy's mom came home and we left. we listened to some random 90's music on the way to middletown, and suddenly, hootie comes on the radio. we have decided that hootie is due for a comeback. all these other crappy artists are making comebacks, but only hootie is worthy. we'd so buy all the new albums if the blowfish came back. the shopping experience with amy and danielle: *i made amy buy a skirt. *i got a belt. its green and orange and blue. it was on these shorts but we didn't want the shorts so we just switched the belt with the really weird ugly one that was on the skirt. *i tried on this obnoxious skirt that looked like it wanted to eat my body. it was so disgustingly awesomely ugly. it was all purple and pink with random black spots on it. it was great. *people looked at us weird. this is not unusual. people always look at us weird when we go out in public. good times. on the way home we could find nothing but linkin park on the radio. it was horrible. we made it good though by singing crazy 2-part harmonies, and making up our own awesomely bad lyrics, because well, we're awesomely bad like that. oh yeah i also borrowed amy's brave little toaster movies because they are the greatest things ever. and now i am going to watch them. goodbye.

"i had a lot to post from yesterday.... but you know what? i'm really not in the mood to write all about that, because it was really not fun. but today, i realized, a lot of people really piss me off. i hate slutty girls. i hate wishy-washy people. i hate stupid people. i hate hypocrites...... ok so i was in the middle of typing this when amy called... we discussed how much we hate everyone, especially paul. then steve took over the computer while held back from stabbing her in the neck with a pen because she's being a dick. and the fashionable thing to do when dicks are unpleasant is to stab them with pens..... that statement was wrong on so many levels.... and now i hate everyone so much that i don't even want to tell you about hating everyone. so instead, i'm going to pack for movie night at amy's, and even though i really don't want to, i guess i need to shower... then i will wait for my mom to come home, and i will leave. then i will come home sometime tomorrow, so can watch lilo and stitch with nick. you see, nick and amy are part of a very small group of people that i actually don't hate. they hate everyone too, so we get along well. did i mention that everyone hates us back? 'cause yeah, they do. i hate people who hate things that they don't understand. ",0
"ok nick was demanding a new post so here it is. dominos for breakfast, goooooooooood shit. let me tell you, its the breakfast of champions.... or well... breakfast of lazy fat ass kids like me and steve. so, spent the whole freaking day cleaning, doing my mom's laundry, cleaning my mom's bathroom, cleaning my mom's bedroom, etc. the things i do for her and what do i get in return? nothing. she wouldn't even let nick come over to watch lilo and stitch with me. stupid bitch. the only other thing i did today was listen to some nice loud music to piss off my stupid whorebag of an older sister, because well, she's a stupid whorebag. so the listening of music went as follows: story of the year (page avenue) something like 2-4 times, alkaline trio (good morning) once, incubus (morning view) once, brand new (deja entendu) twice, and now its on afi (sing the sorrow) which i haven't listened to in quite a long time. i would have included the fabulous motion city soundtrack somewhere in that playlist except that amy still has my cd! but its ok, i can deal with it, because i love that crazy kid...(""he's so mexican!!!!"") oh isn't this lovely? my mother is now yelling at me to turn my music off. my response, turn it up so i can't hear her telling me to turn it off, then when she comes upstairs screaming, i sit there looking downright confused and yell back ""what??? i cant hear you!!!"" at which point she proceeds to shut off the music herself by throwing the stereo at the wall. then she continues yelling while i sit here singing to myself as though the music was still playing, while my mom, overwhelmed by frustration, storms out of the room, cursing to herself...... or i could just turn the music down....nah.... haha if my kids were as obnoxious as me, i'd be just as insane as my mommy.

"ok, so i was reading phil's blog and i thought to myself, ""hey, i should have my own blog."" why, i'm not too sure, but hey, i'm bored, i have no life, why the hell not? it seemed like a good thing to do at the time. we'll just have to see how well this thing actually turns out. so anywho, today is valentine's day. a more suitable name for it, at least for me, is singles awareness day. its just another pointless holiday to remind you how much of a loser you really are. now don't get me wrong, its pretty hard to forget how much of a loser i am. just take this blog for example. considering no one will read it anyway, its a sure sign of my uncoolness. oh well, i am perfectly content with being a loser. its really not so bad. (riiiiight) but anyway, this whole valentine's thing... i don't understand it. wasn't that whole thing just a big massacre somewhere in europe? i really don't know. history's not really my thing. well, i just went downstairs to get a drink and i saw my sister in the kitchen. she was disgustingly giddy with valentine's day cheer... i just wanted to throw something at her. instead i just said, ""sack"" and continued on my not-so-merry little way. everyone has their wonderful little plans for this evening... me? i'll probably just be sitting here alone all night. i had plans to go to rob's with nick and amy and erica for ""sad movie night/ anti-vday party"" however these plans were shot to hell, due to rob forgetting to mention that he'll be in florida. lucky for him, no one could go anyway, so we'll let him live... for now. so since my parents and nick's parents wont be around, and amy's parents are being stupid and imprisoning her in her house, and erica... well... i'm not sure what happened with erica, but because of all of that, we have been forced to cancel our sad movie night, and will all be spending tonight alone. great isn't it? yeah i though so.... or not. well my sister steve (formerly known as michelle, but james and i decided her name should be changed to steve) has decided to cook something so i better go supervise and make sure she doesn't catch the microwave on fire again. tah-tah for now kids. hope you enjoyed the randomness stupidness of my brain.

(except that one time when we made cupcakes instead and rob thought we should make one giant cupcake, like we do with the cookie. think about it. picture a giant cupcake. yes that's right ladies and gentleman. its called a ""cake."") anyway, we decided to make an ""amy's asshole"" themed cookie so they put a big hole in the middle of it, but then when we cooked it, it came out looking like a vagina. so we ate our nice, large, gooey cooter cookie, then i had some mac and cheese which is permanently ruined for me because of the chlamydia. we'll leave it at that. but yeah, so we sort of but not really watched teenage mutant ninja turtles 3. that was pretty much it, besides the usual trampoline wrestling and some other stuff... emoji  (-: what a good night... (: saturday was generally boring but still good, 'cause i'm happy most of the time these days, except where my parents are involved. today was also quite boring because i just cleaned all day and then there was this thing... that made me all sad.... but its all good now... i think.

"woot, its snowing, so we got sent home from school all early and whatnot. and you know what else this means? no lacrosse practice! sweet! so i'm going to sit around and drink apple juice out of a champagne glass and eat some chips. i'm just so amazingly cool like that. *rolls eyes* yeah i think i shall also revisit that old love of mine known as the emogame. so here's how my day went so far...well.. i'm going to start from yesterday... yesterday i went to school, then practice, yaddy yaddah, i was being lazy so i played defense in the drill we were doing and mr. c was like, ""you were doing good on d, maybe we should move you from 1st home to cover point."" and i was like, ""um... i don't know about that..."" because i hate playing defense in games. then varsity had to run hills, so i'm quite grateful for being on jv just for that. oh yeah i got hit in the head again. leave it to me to find a way to get hit in the head, even with those retarded cages/ masks/ goggles/ whatever you want to call them that we have to wear. after practice we were taking the bus home and it was me and courtney and amy and daniel roth and some other random girl that was just kind of there, and we were pretty much sharing my extremely exaggerated sex life with the whole bus. it was awesome, because really, we weren't talking about my sex life. somehow it just seemed like we were. but its all good. it was some quality entertainment. after that, i went home, ate mac and cheese, then went to bed, even though it was only like 6:30. then nick called and we talked till like 10, then i passed out. this morning, i woke up late, showered, then my sister starting yelling that i had to leave in 2 minutes, so i got out of the shower and got dressed and whatnot as quickly as possible, then went to school, did pretty much nothing all day, then found out we were going home early so then in lunch i found out erica was not there which kind of made things boring but i was all talking to jen and nicole, then nick came to visit me, and we looked at pictures he drew in his notebook of people dying. it was fun. then we went home and we were all on the bus and nick had my leg and he kept hitting my knee... ya know, that whole reflex thing, so then everyone was hitting my knee. then nick and natch were pretending to be fitty-cent and then i left and stood on my deck in the snow till my sister came home, then i watched saved by the bell. and that is all. i was all going to go over to nick's with rob but my mom is a waste of life and decided to fall off the face of the earth.

"so here it is, sunday morning/ afternoon-ish... i'm still sleepy, so its close enough to being morning. oh well, i already forget where i was going with this. oh here's some news: so friday, i walk into the locker room after school to get ready for practice, and there is a crowd of girls standing around 2 pieces of paper taped to the wall. all of these girls are lacrosse players, and some of them are crying, so we know what these papers were. the list. so i mosey on over to find out what's going on. the first page had a list of names under varsity and a second list of names under jv regular.  then the second page was entitled ""jv foaters"" (we figured out it was supposed to say ""floaters"") then under this was group a and b. under group a was about 6 names, and then a different list of names under group b. we were/are really confused about this. so anyway, i look on the regular jv list first just to be safe. and holy ball sack, guess what the first name on the list is! yeah it looked something like this (with my added little side comments): jv regulars 1. danielle enman (yes that's right, me... starting jv... bleh) 2. nicole gagliostro (what the gay? that upsets me more than seeing my own name on this list.). blah. blah. blah. some random names including hilary, cole, and others 11. kristen oyen (crazy sometimes-goalie-kid) 12. amy spoer (my spoergasmo! yay! damn goalie bitch :-d) 13>elaine kubik (yes with that exact typo) the end. i forget who was 3-10. no biggy. it was slightly retarded. so then i looked on the varsity list, which had 20 people on it. it was kendahl (obviously), lauren brierly (yay), noel, shell promnitz (yay), taren, marissa (whhhhaaaat???? ouch.), allie ( emoji  my bench bitch wont be sharing the bench with me anymoreemoji  ), and kelly (yeeeahhh....). then there's some other random people that i really don't care about. and then there's linda. it comes as no surprise that linda's on varsity, because, well, linda's awesome. the rest of this list was bullshit. oh well. then this floaters list. apparently, its mostly just the people that would have gotten cut but since someone's a pushover and didn't want to make cuts, we ended up with this floater list. the people in these group alternate between games. group a plays one game and group b plays in the next. the jv regulars will play/ start in every jv game, and some will be moved up to varsity. and honestly? i think this system sucks. oh yeah so friday, phil was allowed to come back to school, which made me very happy. so happy, in fact, that i jumped on him in the hall after lunch and gave him quite a dramatic kiss on the cheek, and people looked at me weird. :-d oh well. friday night, i was waiting around for nick to come over, and chris korwan decided to stop by, and ended up staying the whole night. so it was me, nick, chris, and steve, eating frozen french fries, wrestling on the trampoline, and watching ferngully. chris was all with steve, which was... creepy... to say the least. so then blah blah blah, random things went on, blah blah blah. the end. :-d oh yeah steve kicked me really hard it the back and it still hurts a lot. yesterday i had to get up and go to my lacrosse scrimmage in millburn. it sucked. but me and amy ate mac and cheese on the way there, because we're awesome like that. it was really cold out. it sucked. on the way home i saw a house with a lot of lawn flamingos in the backyard. i'm jealous. so then i went home and slept, and then at 7-something, meagan's all like ""hey, lets go to the movies."" so we did. we wandered around the mall for a while before the movie (50 first dates) started. we went to hot topic and bought shoelaces, and there was all family guy stuff everywhere and i was like, i should get something for james, seeing how he's obsessed with family guy. but i didn't. so then we wandered into h why i'm not sure, but it was fun. i tried on this crazy ugly poofy black and red skirt with a red and white striped shirt. it was great. then i made meag buy a blue plaid skirt. we got in this big music discussion with the cashier guy. it was strange. on the way back to the movie theater, we ran into britt, adam, and stasha. that was strange too. so then we went and saw the movie and it was ok, then we drove home blasting various random punk. it was fun. then i got home at like 12:30, and started watching ""pieces of april"" (which kind of sucked by the way) before passing out. as for today, i have not accomplished a single thing other than cutting up my finch shirt and digging an old shirt out of the back of my closet and cutting fuzzies off of it for like an hour. good times. ",0
"i'm so tired. i'm friggin beat, but i figured, its not even 7:00. i don't want to go to sleep yet, so what better thing to do than update the blog? so yesterday i had to do a timed 2-mile run, at the very beginning of a double lacrosse practice. me and jen finished in 18:45, not too bad... not great though. then there's kendahl who finished the whole thing in like 10 minutes. and by the way, it was also snowing... a lot. i wasn't a big fan of this. then during our fantabulous hour-long break between double practice, we kidnapped some food from kelly's mom.... poptarts and girl scout cookies and such. anyone who went near my cookies had their eyeballs ripped out. i was also getting a lot of weird looks from people as we walked around eating because i was definitely making some sexified sound effects the whole time i was eating. honestly, i quite enjoyed it. then practice #2 went something like this: passing/ catching drills (""quicksticks"" and such), then some sprinting/ throwing/ catching weird sort of shuttle drills for a loooooong time. then we played some keep-away type game things then did a normal game-ish sort of thing... 5 on 5's or something like that. of course i ended up covering linda in the first round, who is ridiculously good, and i also suck crazy bad at anything defensive. put me on offense, and i'm good to go, but defense, its not my thing. then after that we ran a few laps, died, went home, did some random stuff (talked on the phone with nick for like. 002 seconds before i flipped out on my dad and told him to shut the fuck up, then was no longer allowed to use the phone, almost got in a fight with rob, and probably nick too, then just gave up on everything and went to bed.... and cried through pretty much all of that), then passed out. as for today, i was pretty obnoxious today, but that's really ok because it put me in a good mood. faber and lasher took quite a bit of abuse from me, and i will not apologize for it because i enjoyed every second of it, but they are cool kids anyway for taking my shit. as far as lacrosse went, we did a lot of circuit training type stuff, but it wasn't too horrible. except for the background music. some of it was ok, but seriously... really slow techno shit doesn't work for me. its supposed to motivate us to play, not motivate us to cut off our ears. but anyway, after that, we did random rotations, 15 minutes each of running, stick work, and... basketball???.  yeah. my little group consisting of amy, allie, kelly, alyson and rose did our nice little half-assed 15 minute run... we jogged mad slow around the upstairs of the school and took like 5 breaks. normally we have to run for at least 30 minutes, without stopping, and with coaches watching our every move, so it was some well-deserved nothingness. then there was the whole basketball thing which i really do not understand at all. but i have no say in these things so whatever. so out of 3 hours of lacrosse practice, we used our sticks and did something actually somewhat related to the sport for a grand total of 15 minutes. the list is being posted supposedly on friday, so i take it we are also getting uniforms friday considering we have a scrimmage the next day. allie and i are definitely looking forward to the game against jefferson on the 7th because we have acquired quite a few enemies over there in j-town. could it be because we kicked their asses twice? or just because we're assholes? hmmm... w()()t.... i'm so looking forward to running a timed mile tomorrow.... yeeeah not. but hey, its nothing compared to yesterday. oh well.... i'm in a strangely good mood. i don't know why. i think i'm bipolar or something haha.... yesterday i was in a really really bad mood and today i'm in a good one. i have weird random mood swings. oh wellllll, it doesn't matter. at the moment, its all good in the neighborhood. now i think i will attempt to work on my history research thing a little bit and wait for the kid to come home from where ever he is, 'cause at the moment, i have no one to talk to, which is why i am continuing to ramble in this thing. but now i'm done.

"well, yesterday was some good times. i had a lax game against hanover. we won... by a lot... i got my first yellow card (woot woot)! then i went to nick's house, and a bunch of his relatives were there for his confirmation thing. his 2 cousins were like in awe of me... it was crazy. crazy little kids... they were all like playing with my hair and telling nicky to kiss me haha, it was great. then rob said he was going to ride his bike over, so we decided to walk to his road to meet him, so we sat on this big rock on a hill across from a lake (so poetic-ish, haha). we were waiting for like 20 minutes, and rob never showed, so we went back to nick's house and it turns out, rob walked in the front door at the exact same time we walked out the back door. how nuts is that? so rob was all like on the computer playing games and i fell asleep on the floor, then we had food and watched ""my cousin vinny."" then rob left as well as nick's family members and i went back to sleep on the floor with my pillow/ nick and then i went home at 11 and went to sleep in my bed. then today, nick came over and we watched ""malibu's most wanted"" and ""viva la bam"" and he beat me up (mwahaha) and such then he went home (sad face). then i ate star soup and learned 110 sat words then got all crazy confused. it was an enjoyable time. now i'm going to go converse with el chico and eat veggie lasagna, all gangsta-retarded garfield style.

"*sigh*...... emoji  nick is awesome emoji  in other news, today we had a game in wayne hills. we lost. varsity was 13-4 or something, i don't really know because i was sleeping on the ground through that whole game. jv was 6-4. i scored 2 of those 4. w00t. after that we had lunch with their team because last year we threw a lunch party thing for them, so they repaid the favor and we ate a lot. we met this girl who lives in highland lakes during the summer and is going to our junior prom so we're going to see her there. she was nice. i don't remember her name though. oh well. last night nick came over then we went out for pizza and we made him drink stuff because he has a fear of liquids then we went back to my house and watched matilda and dude, where's my car? it was good times. very good times. oh yeah and i got my prom dress motha fuckas. now i'm one of the loser cool kids.

"blah.. i saw marky sweet cheeks today!! i saw him at chrispy's v-ball game, and let me tell you, it made me oh so happy. i went from seeing marko every day in like august and september, then boom, shit happened, and i didn't see marky anymore due to this shit's happening. oh well. tis all good now i guess. i have my first game tomorrow, which was supposed to be friday but was rescheduled due the the ickness of the field and such. friday i got hit in the face with a basketball in gym class and most likely got a concussion, although we'll never really know for sure due to the lack of going to the doctor-ness. i didn't practice lax that day because my head was throbbing. lights still hurt my head, so i just sit in the dark a lot. i spent the whole weekend at amy's, post head injury, since my family went off somewhere and left me behind. we went to the mall saturday, spent $30 of my mom's money on underwear, a belt and 2 shirts, then we went to the school play (sweeney todd) which sucked by the way. except that one... nevermind... all i have to say is this: kermit the frog + a bus = ??? you know. oh yeah, we watched ""gothika"". it was fucked up to say the least. i hate school, yaddy yadda, chrispy hates being penetrated in the ear. goodnight and happy chickens to you all.

"remember when i said ""i love you""?. ... well i still do. but thank you, for making me worthless. now with those alkaline trio and funeral for a friend references successfully and meaningfully enstated, we move on to other....stuff. today i woke up at about 1. i missed a phone call that i've been waiting for forever. actually i've seemed to miss the only calls that matter lately. but i guess it doesn't matter because nothing is going to change and nothing is going to be ok, no matter what is said. the main reason for that is that, well, i suck at life. its as simple as that. i'm still sad. but my day went ok anyway. i did absolutely nothing all day which is ok i guess, but i'd rather not have done nothing alone. there is absolutely nothing i want more than to do nothing at all, as long as nick is there. but he's not. and i can't fix it. and there's nothing i wouldn't give to fix it. i'd give up everything. i know i'm not worth much, but that has to mean something... anyway, after a long lonely day, i had to go to work at 6. this evening i was working with christine and nicole... it was good times. nick's cousin came in 3 times. and of course he came to my window every time so i could get all nice and sad. then nicole dropped an entire cone into the chocolate dip. and we laughed for like 20 minutes straight even though it wasn't really that funny... ok yeah it was. haha. and our boss guy was being a dickface all night, especially after i jokingly called christine a bitch. emoji  well later on christine left, an hour before we closed and me and nicole couldn't finish cleaning anything, especially when phil and eustace and gary came in and harassed us excessively. eustace attempted to fit his entire body through the window and i wanted to close it on his neck and decapitate him, that bastard. then they tried to perform a strip tease and such, and eustace stole all of my lids, which i almost got bitched at for, but i just denied any knowledge of the noise and the fact that there were plastic lids strewn throughout the lobby. gah i want to kill them. but i can't stay mad at those stupid motherfuckers. haha. then as soon as it was 11, nicole and i busted a fuckin move out of that joint. i think my mom was completely wasted too. good frickin times. things are crazy right now. i don't even know what's going on anymore. screw it. i'm tired. and sad. i fucked up, big time. and i no longer believe in second chances, at least not for myself. goodnight. only minus the good part. so i guess just, night.

"so... where do i start now? i've gone and convinced myself that everything is grand. hah, who am i kidding? well i just spent some time reminiscing with one of my best friends the way we did all the time last summer, staying up late and bullshitting about how everything is, was, or will be. i missed that. a lot. more than anyone will probably understand, and more than anyone could possibly care about. after everything, i'm glad we could just pick up right where we left off. besides that, i guess its ok to just spill all of this crap right here, right now since no one will probably ever read it anyway so i don't think it could do that much harm. i never thought that talking about ice cream could piss someone off so much, but leave it to me to succeed in doing that. maybe i've just been doing a whole bunch of little things to piss him off and i didn't realize it till it, i just made him crack, or maybe there's just some hidden crime in simply saying you want ice cream. i don't really know. all i know is that my very own frigging boyfriend completely flipped out on me, entirely out of nowhere when i said that. i really don't fucking understand it. part of me is convinced that for whatever reason, i completely deserved that. and part of me resents the part of me that thinks that ( i dont want to become someone else that i know so well).... i'm sure i did something to provoke the flipping out-age... i just dont exactly have any idea what it was that i did wrong. and after this happens all i get is a repetition of ""i'm sorry i'm such an asshole, go ahead and say it."" yeah i'm sorry you're an asshole too. no attempts to even make me feel better... you hand me a phone and tell me to go home. then you call me this morning to say you get off work at 8 and that i can call you then if i want to talk. its not my move. hence the fact that i didn't call. you pushed me away. you flipped out on me. you can fix it if its worth it to you. the way i see it, if you don't try, its not worth it to me, because i didn't deserve that.... or did i? i don't know. maybe if you explain it to me.... there's more bullshit, but i no longer feel like sharing. cool. my life is grand. here we fucking go again.

"thats an awesome line. silly thursday. anywho. not sleeping and not eating is making me really sick. its not good. i drove solo today. first i went to the high school to drop off my senior picture junk and fix my schedule. its so random: 1. english- kaicher 2. calculus- freifelder 3. gym (with the love of my life, amy.) 4. human bio- kuplin (again with amy.) 5. lunch (with erica, natch, dan rist, and nicoley oley bonilly. excellent i say.) 6. italian- haddeland (was physics but fuck that) 7. photo major- roppolo 8. spanish ap- galati (with alyson, and such.) pretty decent senior year, i'd say. i'm not slacking off or anything this time around. so anywho, then i drove to dairy queen so my boss could make me some lunch and to get some ice cream for steve. and a coke because i needed caffiene, hardcore. i should have just gotten some bawls, dammit. after that i delivered ice cream to steve, then went to mike's house to drop off his sunglasses. emoji  they'll come back to me someday, mwahaha. then i found james' house and then almost hit a dog. then i wont home and then decided i needed to get gas to cover up all of the aimless driving i did. then i talked to amy on the telephono, and i just remembered i was supposed to call her back, and then i looked at the time and realized, fuck i have to shower and get ready for work now. so goodbye for now, blog viewers.

"i dedicate this update to a dear friend of mine whom i last seen his smile on 8th february, 2003. his name is chong csen dik... and are known to us as aki riku. the eldest son in the whole family, he was a perfect senior to fool with everyday after school. basically, you won't find him in class most of the time. he's another one of those naughty and black-listed students that most teachers won't want to handle. i knew him through his sister, aki reiko. reiko was my best friend since the first day i entered junior high. she was the one who introduced me to the chinese society in this new environment of mine in which, i thought would suck. ah, well... for a nao girl like me, it doesn't matter. i still remember that every afternoon after school, reiko and i will walk home, discussing and sharing what had happened on that day since i'm in a different class. and there goes riku-sempai riding his bmx, snatching my books or my bag away from me with a bunch of his friends. he's a playful chap from day one. for several times since the first time i have been introduced to him, he had been playfully serious, saying ""be my girlfriend,"". and i would throw him the rolling eyes frown and says that he's crazy. reiko would often say, he's mad and he's a total pain in the ass... and truthfully, i missed those days. i missed his loud mouth, his spirit and his smile. i missed him. the last time i seen him was on a friday afternoon, 8th february, 2003. he was driving his red kancil and passed us with a cute smile, waving. he had already graduated that time. he left his hair to grow long and dyed it in shades of brown and blonde. he looks totally cute that time and that was one smile in which will be remembered forever. ryujin, hyuzu and me was in my otousan's car. ryusuke was driving. two days after, a sunday... on 10th february, ryusuke had just came home from his girlfriends' house. his face was pretty pale. but, he came home with a 'tadaima' and still manage to check wether i had known about the news or not. i was totally clueless, ironing my school uniform, getting all ready for the big, hectic monday. he walked towards the pc and stopped the songs that i listed to play. ryusuke walked into the dry kitchen and confronted me. ""did you hear about it yet...? riku... had passed away... in an accident,"" he slowly told me. i stared at him, strange. ""life and death is not a joke, you moron..."" i snapped at him, still thinking he was joking. ""i'm not... joking. there was 6 person in the car. two passed away this evening, in the hospital... one of them, was riku...,"" he pulled out a chair and sat on the mozaic dining table. i remained in silence. halted. to me, all that were plain lies. some absurd joke. ""they're still in critical condition,"" he just stared the kitchen floor. i stopped doing what i was doing earlier and headed to call hyuzu... in hopes, she might have known more than what i had heard from my brother. i told hyuzu everything and she too thought i was out of my mind. hyuzu was very sceptical. she chose to wait for a bigger announcement. i then called niji. niji filled me in about the accident and said she had also heard that riku-sempai had passed away. and all of a sudden, yakumo appeared in my mind. niji said that the number of confirmed people involved in that accident was 6 but, has yet to know who the other 5 were. dead concerned, i soon found out that yakumo had rejected the bunch's offer to go to genting highlands that night. it was a gloomy monday morning. yumi was the first i met and she had already received the news on sunday, first thing in the morning. she was all quiet. all the chinese girls and guys were silent. all, waiting for the moment of truth, for news to be announced by the headmistress. i was alright. in fact, i did not shed a tear since i heard the news. i couldn't cry... but, i remember, i couldn't bear to keep it anymore when the whole school gasped in a grave surprise upon the announcement. ""i believe in what i could do. now, if you just let me do it, one last time..."" riku's words of rang in my head brings me back... the training sessions of 2002's sports day has begun and that was when we got a news that riku-sempai has a motorcycle accident and he sprained his ankles so badly, he could not walk for almost a week. when he has done resting, he quickly came back for track and field trainings. he was one of the best chinese sprinters in our school and one of the best in green house, in which, i too was a committee. i became his personal 'manager' and yumi was the 'nurse'... we would tag along with him in any event. i remembered there was once... on a training day in which yumi and i were both not needed to attend... i still make it an effort to go to the school field to check riku-sempai's condition. after that day, the guys actually spread rumours about me being his girlfriend since i'm attending every one of his training(which is a must since i am one of the green house's sprinters and one of the first aid team members) and took care of him. ""he isn't doing very good. he should stop,"" one of the lady teachers told me. ""doctors said if he goes on doing it, he'll not be able to run for his whole life,"" yumi looked at me, pale. riku-sempai was still adjusting the bandages and all on the starting line where the other track runners and coach gets ready. yumi pulled me to go advise him to stop. he didn't listen and told us that he's alright. it isn't our league to stop him. both me and yumi are just his normal juniors that he meets once in a while... during the final trainings, i met him in the canteen and he was sitting on the bench, changing his shoes and getting ready to go... i approached him. surprisingly, my heart was not in storm. i sat beside him and asked him not to run. he smiled at me and asked why was i so worried. ""you're our hope for green house to win this year... don't go on. you might hurt yourself today,"" with a light tug on his sleeves(i never done something this daring before, really!). he left with an 'i'll be alright,'. as what i had feared, he made the wrong move and stumbled. i quickly ran to his aid as he crawled to the side of the track, without wanting to be in other runners' way. he moaned in pain but, i couldn't do anything but to call for the teachers and senior medics to help me aid him. he was carried in, to where he could rest and go see the doctor after that. on the big day, even though the green house's coach had warned him not to enter the tracks, he approached. there wasn't enough runners to cover the list. riku-sempai sent himself to the track. ""it was my dream... my dream to be malaysia's proud sprinter... but, i know, i can't. this is my final year here. if i don't get selected this time, i'll never get in..."" he looked far out to the finishing line. ""i want to run for my dreams... i want to run for my country... i want to run for this school,"" he left. i was being called in to get ready for the 4x100meters run and as i walked towards the green house's camp, i heard friends screaming 'don't go on!' and look backwards. riku-sempai was fumbling in his steps and struggled to stay on his feets but, crashed instead. he was the leading one out of the 6 runners but, his fall has failed him. however, he did not lost in that race... he was the winner in everyone of the green house's committees and coach's heart. til today... i have never been able to summon the courage to ask reiko about the location of riku-sempai's altar in the temple... reiko and i had grown apart since year 2000 because we both have seperate lives then. we did remained good friends though. and i had never ask about how she was since the day i had heard about the accident... ""what the heck are you doing to your lab reports! what are these sea horses and clown fishes doin here?!"" kouri, reiko's best friend asked her at the assembly one day. ""this two clown fishes... my dearest miyazaki-kun and myself... the other one here is my brother...!"" she continued with a big smile and the sweet grin on her fair and rosy complexion. i, who was listening by the side was so touched by her courage and will power to leave the past frames and move on. it's true that no one cold turn back time and no one could bring back the dead. it's just comforting enough to know that, even though he's not visible anymore, riku-sempai's spirit forever lingers in the hearts of every single person who had knew him. and he thought me some of the most important lessons in life... and now, he's still teaching me. teaching me how to appreciate life. teaching me that even though his light has been dimmed, the others must still shine and go on living. teaching me to tell how important someone is to me. if only i had learnt to tell you how important you are to me; if only... i had learnt to appreciate you before this. -----------------------------------------------------das ende---------- well... heh... i guess this is the first time i'm writing a heart chapter for my journal. i'm not very good as expressing what i think and feel through words but, i think i could write better than i speak. so, this is just the brief experience of life's most bitter moments so far. i just remembered about him so... =3 thanks for reading. the cerulean sky, ~ciel~ ",0

"that was said by my good friend roger once, as he was drunkenly hanging onto an awning over a door of a small cafe. of course, immediately after he said that, it cam crashing down and we all ran off into the night. los angeles is a fucking great city and it's been great to me. i live in a loft in downtown los angeles. i woke up this morning early and drove roughly 30 minutes to the beach, where i got my kidneys pounded by the 10-foot surf of the pacific ocean and a pretty good sunburn. you can do anything here in los angeles. yes, there stuff about los angeles that everyone always complains about does suck, but that's just one part of it. los angeles is filled with people who hate it. they are stuck here working in the entertainment industry and they aren't making the big bucks, so it's a struggle. cry me a river. life in the big city is tough. suck it up, crybaby. los angeles (and california) have been great to me. i knew once i stepped off the plane for a 2-week vacation in 1993 that this was my ne home. i never left. adios, east coast. have a nice winter. i suffered for a little, then fell ass-backwards into money and some degree of fame and fortune in the music buisness (artist side). that came to a rather abrupt screeching halt when i got fed up with the bullshit. nothing 6 months or so in hawaii couldn't fix though, right? now, i work as a designer for the biggest video game company in the world on arguably one of the top 10 game titles in the world. the last game i worked on sold 5 million copies and is still selling (and is also viewed as a failure by the company...whatever...more ranting about that to come). life is good. los angeles is good. my dog is good. - art. np - ""edward appleby (in memorium)"" - rushmore soundtrack ",2
"online dating is weird. many of us do it. there are many reasons. my reason to try it was because as i begin to get to an age where you are supposed to act like an adult, i realized that my interest in bars and getting wasted and trolling for girls is incredibly hollow and ultimately unsatisfying. so, i found myself on an internet dating sight. you make up a profile and post it along with photos that you think accurately depicts who you are and hopefully, the type of animal you are interested will wander into your area because they smelled something good to eat. so now, you have a virtual human zoo. you stroll around, looking in all of the pretty environments (but let's face it...you can dress it up all you want...it's still a cage) at the inhabitants. you see one you like and you spend some time there. checking it out, reading the little info card. you learn about what it likes, what it dislikes, it's habits and fears. you become educated in it's entire life (or at least a smart, punchy bio-blast cramming the life into a short paragraph) and then you make a choice. is this one of my favorite animals or not. if you choose yes, that particular animal goes into another smaller, exclusive, private collection. now you have all of your favorite animals in your own private zoo. this is the part that creeps me out the most. the personal people collection. more on this later... today i'm meeting someone from my personal collection. i've developed a really great friendship with her online and over the phone. we are already very well-suited for each other. it's like i've known her a year already. we have everything in common. it all started very carefully, and as guards were let down, it became very apparent that something was there. as of late, i've noticed that the ""romantic"" element has gone by the wayside and the friend part has been developing at a rapid pace. our meeting should be interesting. i'm pushing for romance. - art. np - ""self destruction, final"" - nine inch nails. kind of on a thing right now...

"our trip up here was a little squishy with four of us in a ford ranger, but we managed. we arrived at about 10:30pm and pretty much unpacked and went to bed. the next morning was helga and jeff's turn for breakfast, they made scrambled eggs and hashbrowns. yum. after breakfast we went to albas to see the falls. it was beautiful and there were so many falls all along the river. i took lots of pictures. when we were done hiking we were ready for a swim. the lake was beautiful and it had a sandy beach, so we spent the rest of thr day there. that night nikki prepared lasagna for dinner, it was delicious. we proceeded to get into the games, of course there were drinks involved. after a few rounds we decided it was time to go to the dance here in town. when we arrived there was terrible ricki martin music playing. nikki was not feeling well so she went outside and started to run around the tables outside, so i followed her. we created quite a show for all the boys at the party. we then left but nikki did not want to go in the car as she thought it would make her sick. nikki, vicki and i all walked back to the cabin. on the way nikki did get sick anyway. nikki's aunt gloria followed in the van, i climbed in the van part way as i had run back to tell gloria to just go ahead but she felt better staying to make sure we were ok. nikki finally climbed in the van and we told her to count to 60 three times so we proceeded to count out loud. i guess at the cabin people were wondering what was going on cause all they heard was a speeding van and counting. afterall the excitment we were ready for bed. sunday was our turn to make breakfast, we made breakfast fajitas, they were delicious. after breakfast we went up to seymour falls. it was amazing. we decided that today was beach day, so vicki and ryan packed us a lunch and off to the beach we went. it was another perfect day so we worked on our tans. no one signed up for dinner so we went to the local restaurant for dinner. we got back to the cabin started a fire a just took it easy. monday morning vicki ryan made pancakes and bacon. delicious! the whole process was quite entertaining. time to pack up and head home. what a wonderful weekend!

"i'm pretty busy this morning. wake up early to get my sister to lrt-then buy some nasik lemak-breakfast-get dressed laju giler coz its already 8.. and time tu jugaklah air pulak takde.. kenalah mandi air sejuk this morning.. hii.. of all the sudden..without any notice! if u ask me- 'ni mesti keje geng2 construction nearby nih!' ada construction nak buat flat just nearby my house. memang crowded giler.. sekarang ni pun dah jammed kat jalan bawah tu..lagilah kalau ada lagi tambahan population kat sini. nak marah lelebih pun bukan tanah aku.. kat umah meriah pagi nih. pagi2 dapat tengok muka arween ngan fatin bangun sengih-sengih. best sangat dapat hug ngan kiss diorang pagi-pagi walaupun masam gila..heheh..my niece from melaka pun datang nak spend weekend ngan we all.. my mum just consider her visit as ""menyerah diri"" sebab there's 2 girls to babysit..sorang demam and sorang gi kecik sangat.. cakap pun tak buleh lagi..haha..we all semua kena keja..so dia lah yang kena.. nasiblahh.. but since she's here.. me and my sister mulalah tanduk kuar nak jalan2.. haha.. tak sedar broke giler.. nanti bila dah keluar tu mulalah nampak itu lahh..nak beli inilah.. since awal bulan we dah buat hat-trick.went for movies like crazy.. semuanya nak tengok.. (apa lagi ah citer yg tak tengok gi..?) i'm writing from office today. still working out my perspective drawing yang tak siap-siap since dunno when. asal my boss keluar je.. hah.. mulalah cari other thing yang lagi best. no music in the office-pc broke down. no radio-busan gila. aku pulak lupa nak bawak cd ke.. agghh.. takpe.. positive! apepun today is far better than yesterday of course. semalam lagilah dashyat. dah la macam2 jadi since morning. dah petang tu , konon nak release pressure by tulis mail kat mon cher.. punya lah panjang i wrote to him..semuanya lah..all lovey dovey words.. wishing him good luck..etc..etc..for one flat hour.. the minute i clicked the ""send"" button- baru i nampak. .i typed his address wrong. aaaagggghhhhhhhhhhh............!!!!!!!!! stood still for couple of minutes. blur. dunno what to think. can't even move. rasa terberenti brain skejap. then my hp bunyik. (hah..!mon cher) mangsa lah dia kena dengar i punya cerita pressure stok sepanjang hari punya.. still rasa blur. . when he said ""camana boleh salah taip tu....?"" and ""camana boleh jadi macam tuuuu...."" i still cannot figure out what and why is all that happening to me.. all at once pulak tu...! today..tak tau lah apa pulak. so far okey ajer. my boss and i takdelah banyak communicate sangat. just talk benda yang perlu ajer. since i'm the only worker he has..so i guess he's trying to keep me to guard his office..picking up calls..design..cadd drawings..presentation drawings.. isk. semualah! he keep on saying he'll find other personnel-but it's been months now since our last designer resigned.. and dah berbulan lah i've been alone in this office. everything semuanya buat sorang-sorang. mesti orang kat luar tengok i some kind of pelik. haha.. and my friends pun sometimes make fun of me sebab keje sorang2 nih. but it turns out i'm very comfortable working alone. i'd do whatever i want at my own pace and kepala otak. no need to gossip or to dress up like crazy..make up like clowns.. there's nobody here.. my boss? haha.. dia lagilah selekeh. he really doesn't mind no matter how i look. he came - ask me daily progress-check letters or fax messages..then at about 10 he'll go out. dunno where. then.. he comes back after lunch.. then goes out again.. haha.. my tanduk goes in and out banyak kali gak lah dalam sehari.. i'm not really 'cheating' while working. but since this is a small consulting firm-with various status projects..just making sure my work is done-then only i 'party' laa..bukan sesuka hati jer...haha.. hah..counting hours la nak balik.. bila ada my nephews or nieces kat rumah..mulalah eager sangat nak balik. i'm still far away from 5.30. so.. better fill up my days with works. sambil2 tu lam kepala dok pikir..(isk.. dapat ke tak aa gaji nanti..?). .agghh...next month will be tough.. 2 close friends are getting married.. have to spare extra money for hadiah ngan trip gi penang lagi.. ushhkk.. peninggg... :: this is why kita selalu heran when it comes to 'money'. dialah racun.. dialah ubat..hah...peninggg...

"it's already 1 pm. as usual i'm not going out anywhere - rasa kelakar lunch sorang-sorang. so i take out my donat and air kosong from home- and have my lunch. ingat nak call mon cher but i bet dia tengah prepare nak gi semayang jumaat. huhh.. today dah jumaat. cepatnya masa berjalan. nanti sabtu-ahad dah joli lebih kurang sikit2..pastu pressure sebab dah monday balik. sometimes i nak ajer jadi exceptional. trying to have a wonderful monday..but back to what we call a 'reality'.. it will bite us back. no need to pretend that weare having so much fun in life,when deep down inside we are crying and dying- asking for a better 'everything'. i know i sound 'tak bersyukur dengan apa yang ada'.. but as a person.. i would say that this ""reality"" thing is very tough. very.. very tough..! maybe i've seen better picture of life before.. my parents, as far as i remember. .were government servants..we moved around west semenanjung a lot..which influent my perangai now... quarters with security guards..good schools..home-tuitioned..few friends of course.. pindah again.. new school..same thing..bla..bla.. but now i realise..all that somehow broaden and at the same time narrowing my scope of life. conflicts. when i was in kuantan for my diploma.. new friends again.. but with various background. then only reality sikit-sikit nak tunjuk belang. tengok everyone punya true colour.. but then mana matured lagi.. nak 2 time tu lah baru rasa freedom.. with course yang memang banyak visits.. back to reality punya cerita.. still i don't really pikir sangat pasal susah nak cari duit etc.. takde duit..call.. ada new project..call.. (haa.. wonder what i'd say if i'm in my mama's place then..) sure nangis punye lahhh.. degree was ok financially.. sebab i ada loan. but still mintak kat abah bila dah ujung semester.. tapi banyak habis kat travel lah.. minyak.. tol.. huu.. then only that reality keep on haunting me.. jahat betull.. since i graduate last year.. anything i wanted to do seems to be blocked. tak yah mention during study dulu memang dah pening gile nak habiskan even satu semester.. but this time it's different. i'm grateful i did manage to finish school before..and since everything is giving me a hard time sekarang..i fell kinda lost. time tu la nak cari keja susah..apply nak further study-my degree pulak dikata tak diiktiraf. . sadly i have to defer my cardiff offer tonext year.. with nothing promising.. hope my abah won't say anything about me wasting money for exams etc.. (erghhh..sad!sad!) at last.. dapat lah keja sini.. alaa..sini..yang tak best nih...(again tak grateful lansung!!heh) with that kinky boss.. nearby office from home..kira okey laa than dok rumah idling waiting for my parents to feed me. malulahh..dah suku abad umur still takde profesion lagi. although tak satisfied sangat with salary scheme-i accept this job and try to be more positive with it..(grateful..) hehe.. almost 4 months here..with 1 months party sebab my boss went to china to participate in new project (that's what he claim laa..) i dunno how to describe - how my life has been. sruggling - saving nak kawin la.. daily expenses laa.. entertainment..belanja mama tosei..phone bills.. bla..bla..bla.. hah! is this my life i'm going through?? now only i learn how to aprreciate each cent in my purse... dah pulak my boss critically takde income,and as expected - kacau perjalanan gaji aku laa.... who's to blame? ntahh.. abah pun dah bising my phone bill makin banyak and banyak... then, banyak jugak benda2 jahat yg allure my attention.. bantal pires lahh.. perfume laahhh..aussino bedsheet laa.. huu.. sedar2 ajer my purse tinggal syiling.. tu pun sempat lagi sedekahkan kat public phone.. heh.. cintaaaa.. cam gitu lahhh.. why aah..? why is it has to happen to me..? is it i don't give enough thinking and vision when i was younger.. ?i should have expected all this. my mama constantly reminding everyone of us that life upfront is not going to be easy.. familiar words like "" mama takde harta lain nak bagi.. just ilmu ajer..itu lah yang all of you kena pakai nak hidup"". . and now.. it does make sense... although nak kena kena face toughtimes sementara nak habiskan july nih.. i should give more attention towards myself. .and more thoughts about future..maybe sebelum ni tak cukup thoughts ( that's why kat mulut kata nak jimat tapi tangan dok membeli). . sebab tu still consider all this as burden..unfair..etc.. and maybe i should look forward to dekatkan diri ngan tuhan..

"tough morning..but yet cold and breezy..the only thing that make me smile - henman win 1st round kat toronto. .(heh!). .then headed to office as usual-alone-with nothing to be expected..tapi dalam banyak2 benda- my pc broke down! no more ym with frenz and mon cher.. another sebab nak tambah busan kat my days.. ergghhhh!! jammed skejap kepala.. heh! tapi still okey.. using another pc.. start wandering what to do..mulalah search sana..search sini..kot2 ade mende narik nak baca etc.. then i came across my sister's fren punya blog..mmm..narik tu... create blog sendiri.. takdelah busan sangat..heheh..then..klik sana sikit..sini sikitt..heheh.. my first publishing.. so jangan gelak tau? sebab standard lah beginner... hehe.. mm.. so far nothing much to say. dalam kepala dok serabut ngan pc yang dah jem tu.. tatau nak buat apa.. tak berenti asyik scan disc ajer..nak shut down pun gagal jugak...heh.. biar ajerlah dulu.. so hope from now on-my days will be much. .much better with this new i-don't-know-how-to-say hobby..(can i say hobby?) ape2 jelah! selalu kita cakap dalam hati ajer pasal everything. . so now, at least boleh express anything yang kita wish to say.. hope boleh fill up my days yang almost ""empty' tu.. i've read a few blogs yg i rasa mmg very interesting..about how they felt.. and i felt satisfied sebab there are things yang i wish to say out loud and that somebody dah tolong expresskan..heheh..so from now on.. my turn pulak.. hope i can be as good as that writer..(of course she's good..she's a writer!) but from what she had said. .kebanyakkannya mmg betul and i learn a lot from her writings.. thanks! she gave me some kind of encouragement - and have my own blog...heh! :: everyday kena ada something new kita kena belajar kan? so.. this is for today... : ) ",1
my sis forwarded me this blog.. her frens's fren's frens' blog. hehh.. lantaklah sapa punye.. but i kinda like what she's blabbering around.. same age as mine and probably got the same thoughts too... i agree quite a lot with her words.. for instance this one.. of she said how other people ( i think what she means is people who already married) should give more support and positive advices towards newly married and singles who's still looking for partners - as what she referred to 'threats' of how miserable can a marriage be. come'on ol pals.. you guys should show us matured acts and words aa.. bukannya demoralise us lagi.. ,1
"finally i got myself and my thoughts back. still sittin' on the same chair, listening to music mon cher gave me recently.. they really keep me accompany. thanks mon cher. an ol' 80's song which i used to listen when i was a kid- tommy page's a shoulder to cry on. i'm cool now.. no more protests or grumbles. i took my thoughts for a short tour. to remember that i still have a lot of things and love ones by my side. to remember that there's still other people who is far in need than i am. i wonder what i'd do if god suddenly put me in a war town or something.. will i fight to survive..? will i just lay there waiting to die..? will i help others..? what would i do..?? hah..? will my soul ever get strong..? by hook or by crook.. i have to be strong.. i have to be.. nobody else will help me.. they'll surely covering their own ass ! so..intann..? ready to take the steps..? it's 2nd of rejab now. i guess it's time to get back to things you've taken for granted for quite so long now... and you know you can never get any stronger without the blessings of god.

i'm listening to the corrs ol' song- 'don't say you love me'.. kinda drag me into another world..a place i once comfortable with.. that's what i fancy about songs.. make me wander to my good ol' days.. bad days.. haha.. nev'mind... right now i'm enjoying every words of it.. ,1
it's monday again. believe it. buang masa ajer if you still cannot accept that time is moving soooooooooo fast and that you're having a tough time in life. oh no. must remember my resolution last week. positive. okey..okey.. it's monday-but different from other mondays. today i have loads of works to do. i 've finished with platinum condo drawings last week- and now come newly proposed kajang housing development. presentation on coming thursday and i have to start from zero. alone. my boss?? dunno where he is- but thank god he's not here. haha.. i have so much to say-but no time at all. right now i'm chatting with mon cher-now in his hometown for a short break. something's coming up i guess - we have to stop chatting for a while. alaa.. already 1.30. have to stop now. get back to y'all after thursday !! intann : the truth is- i'm still the same. it's just things surrounding me is moving and evolving and changing.... do not worry. okey? ,1
i can't believe i'm here. at this tiny office.at this moment. me - staring hopelessly at the monitor. adie- who is now teaching - just gave me one stupid idea : 'panas..? masuk dalam peti ais...' mamat tu sorang memang nak kena dari dulu lagi.... heeeeeeeeeeeeee.... ,1
"i read my best friend's email just now.. suddenly i felt lost. she asked me whether i already got the invitation card-which i did received last week. i was planning to call her but - with so much to think- i forgot. as usual- we talk.. she told me that she's been counting days now-12 days to go. she's getting married..!! can you believe it..? she was the one i used to quote as 'kanak-kanak riang' - as she's a petite gal.. ( now i dunno- its been months since i last met her) but for sure..selalu hilangnye lah kat supermarket tu! hehhehehe.... at the end of the mail, she wrote - although she's married- we shall be friends - the same as we used to be. that 'lost' feeling dragged me into tears. i replied her mail. promise her that i will be the same..as i wish her too. i was crying while typing-as if being so skeptical- (of what?? of losing her..?) i am glad she's getting married.. she's a good person - and definitely deserve a good one also. (yeen..better be good to her, ok?) it's been 10 years now since i met her and since then-we never stop talking! 10 years..? can u believe that nida? all sorts of stories was once our topics- studies, exams, boys, love, crushes, heart-breaks, new friends..ol' friends.., then love again..drop-dead-cute-office-attire guys, my ans..your abans..hahahah.. so much we've said and laughed about.. and i miss all that.. so much..

my brother always come up with silly words- and usually we all ended up laughing about it.. words like..'harrraaammm...'..'sadissss..' tu semua memang kat mulut la...!my sister and i were suggesting going for halle berry's latest show- catwoman. we usually 'have' to be accompanied by him..and his wife. but plan malam ni - only us ajer sebab mama abah tader kann.. hehehe... i'm writing from office. no urgent work to do. still.. a lot of calls to do.. where is my 'intann to do' list?? hah? tapi my fingers still on this keyboard- chat ngan adi n my sis. hish..macam2 plan lah kami nih! nanti bila dah petang mulalah kalut..heheh.. err..best ke cerita kucing betina tu...? mon cher said it was given so much publicity-but-not as he expected.. heh.. dunnolah how comic-addict talks bout their stuffs. i usually end up angguk ajer.. hehe.. malam kang my turn pulak nak komen. hah.. makan invitation again! i have another sister who endlessly ajak both of us to her house. she's the one with two boys (sorang penakut-sorang gi energetic terlebih!) alternate week - she'll be alone sebab her hubby is out to work. just don't imagine how are these 2 boys are..! so - if ada invitation ajak makan n tido at her place tu.. equals to babysitting up until 1-2 in the morning. haha..dunno lah air bateri cap apa yang diorang minum.. oit! nak gi tak ? :: intann - movie..works..borang to settle.. what to eat tonite..? buy ink cartridge..bla..bla..the list goes on.... haaaaaa......(yawn..) ,1
"monday again.. mmm.... : ) did i forget something..?? ermm.. kejut mon cher bangun tido..checked! makan ubat..checked! forms etc..checked! so.. dahh.. mon cher start his final exam today.. (wish u luck!) saje jer kuar dari rumah 5 mins to 9. my boss is still in genting and this is the best opportunity nak mengular.. hahaha.. smooth flowing traffic - good music - enough! i arrived at the office feeling 'okey'. haha.. actually i'm delighted! arsenal won the community shield game last night meeting with traditional rival- man utd - and it was really..really..an entertaining game. at first i was down sebab pires was not in the list- tapi since dah lama tak tengok game.. eager sangat nak tengok this team main semalam sans familiar faces.. no more viera.. kanu..parlour...ergh... still they have to move on. the world's moving right?? so..nev'mind laa..new faces pun.. everyone pun penah jadi new faces gak dulu..so.. the kick-off! awesome! as if semua pun dah busan sebab dah lama tak main-so everyone seemed to be so energetic! attemps were breathtaking..cuma finishing jer kantoi.. still.. thumps-up to all new faces! fabregas..hoyte..clichy..van persie..heheh.. good work guys! reyes deserved his man-of the match award-elok la dah nak patah riuk pinggang..haha.. 3-1 full time result. inclusive one own goal. charming cole! hahahah... so, starting next week- no more jalan2 during match nights... so much thing to do today. my sister and i have to list down everything we have to do since mama ngan abah nak travel north. a lot (uisk..banyak lahh!) aktiviti-aktiviti tak berpaedah lingers in our minds- jahat betull... mulalah nak tengok movie tu la..ni laaa.. hah..camana..? but still..i have to settle down everything regarding job application first. have to photostate forms and all.. urghh.. penatnyee.... ::intann - help! where to start..? i've so much to sayyy.....

(really annoyed with my phone bills...!) i came across lagu amy grant-that's what love is for this morning on my way to work.. hahh..!! dah agak dah.. they really dragged me into 'emotional' daydreaming again.. love..love and love..with everybody is pursuing love nowadays.. we sometimes forget that love can be a cruel deceit. believe me or not... those kinda songs actually lead us to become a love devoter or a soul provider...which is for me.. not suitable for those who has a partner who don't really care about what love is all about.. we hear a lot about love stories..not to mention all love movies that we take 'em as a perfect dream-dying to get one love life similar to that.. start la berangan jadi heroin la..hero laa..haha..! ( if you asked who's my perfect hero..jude law-empty face-tall and skinny.. haha.. get me off my feet) usk..lari tajuk dah ni..! i wonder macam mana people want from love nowadays. macam-macam yang i dengar since forever.. failed relationship..tak cukup understanding la.. betrayals..tak honest with each other..find new guy/gal.. where the hell all the vows once uttered from their mouth..? bukan man ajer yang i know simply take people heart for granted..girls pun.. sama je... hu... . i owed my mum for her continuous advise - "" do not love a man more then they love you.. "" , ""girls shouldn't be the one craving..or she'll be the one crying "".. after my first relationship failed 4 years ago, then only i know what she meant.. (blur betul dulu2..) haha.. i'm glad it's over. i moved on - with new rule for myself. don't ever let a loser enter and rule your life..  worst lagi to love 'em..lagi worst if you deny his mistake! intann : once mon cher asked me..how i want him to be.. i answered him.. "" be a man..like a man should be."" ",1
wonder if you guys ade dengar lagu from ally mcbeal- banyak yang best.. but this 'alone again' song - captured my attention sebab quite slow and sedey skit lagu dia.. i dengar for quite some times before i know that the lyrics bukanlah totally 'love' based. dia try nak cerita hidup dia since dulu.. always have to cope with person she love died and leave her alone.. try lah dengar one day..really nice!. mm.. talking pasal 'death' ni..(frankly-i'm scared..) i dua tiga menjak nih quite often dreamed pasal dead people.. people accident.. my father's close friend accident and return home.. macam2 lah..! (usk.. dahlah uncle tu suppose to join us jalan2 pegi thai next month!) memang if kita just cakap pasal 'death' ni kita rasa okey ajer.. but at the moment kita browse balik what we've been doing all thru this living years..and banyak sins dari kebajikan.. then only we think twice.. kan? kan? just pagi tadi..on my way to work.. i saw one slight survivor just 10metres ahead of me. one old chinese man..driving an iswara- dunno where he's heading to..(kalut sangat)..time2 jammed macam tu nak jugak move hastily.. but to my surprise.. (and his of course!) he was hit by a tanker- i should say he's fortunate enough sebab it was right betul2 the driver's side. kalau that tanker speed lebih sikit..hah.. i by now mesti muntah tengok flesh and blood.. but think again man.. a tanker tu.. nasib tak baik.. hah..dapatlah tengok 'live' explosion. . tu pun kalau i tak involve sekali.. (huuu..mintak simpangg..) i tak kawin lagi lahh.. but this is not sebab i still tak kawin then i'm talking about this.. tapi kalau you all tengok muka that ol'man - you guys akan rasa dia ni try nak commit suiside ke..? selamber gile.. walaupun panic..(sikit2 ajelah potray panic tu) tapi.. once he's out of the car.. siap pointed out to the tanker's driver..dunnolah.. marah ke..maki ke.. still nak denied his mistake.. huh.. he should be grateful he still alive man...(wonder where his heart is..hehe) for whom yang penah been thru an accident-akan tau the real feeling. betul.. just by thinking of it right now- memang rasa eerie sangat.. i was 4 going to be 5..when i had an accident involving my uncle's car and a taxi loaded with people. my mak teh brought my sis and me to a kenduri kawin in perlis. we were already on our journey back to alor star. everything was okey at first. i was sound asleep-then i heard a loud collision-i saw blood-blood and blood everywhere..i was in a total blur. someone dragged me and my sister out of the car.. but the truth is- i can't feel myself.. i can remember things-but the shocking current still overpowered me then. my aunt and uncle were motionless. the moment i saw them..i felt unprotected. i cried. then the collision sounds and pictures of blood repeatedly playing in my mind..(up until now you know..) i was scared to death.. i felt so small..but i can still picture everything very clearly.. like it is always been part of myself. my uncle and aunt died in that accident-leaving 8 children. with that.. i grow up feeling phobia with accident. takut weh.. tapi takdelah sampai tak kuar mana2 or tak drive. ada gak time yang i drive nak cepat etc.. tapi when i see news ke.. lori besar2 speeding.. haa.. time tu.. mulalah mulut baca macam2..takut la.. but one thing i learn from that.. not to follow the same mistake again. ( i know it's not my uncle and aunt's mistake that i have to be in that tragedy..)no one's is to be blame.. betul. maybe it's god fate kami alami semua tu.. and now i come across the same situation where i ada gak bawak my nieces and nephews keluar jalan2.. so time tu lah all this pictures and sound playing in my mind. c'est horrible man.. trust me. once my cousin asked me why i drive slow sangat one time tu..kami konvoi balik my mum's house sesama. . with their only daughter insisted to go with me. so.. dah lah lalu jalan yang i paling phobia..slow jelah... lagipun bukannya nak rush pegi mana ye ak..? why i drive slow sangat..? i repeat.. slow..? better slow laa... kan..? apa i nak jawab if anything happen to us..? guys.. value your life ok..? why am i talking about this today?? entah.. that ol' man pagi tadi tu laa.. hish.. wonder what he's thinking.. hope he learn something.. and as expected.. that fatal incident movie played again..i just cannot imagine have to face life without our love ones.. aghhhh.. god i'm so scared.... al-fatihah to pak teh and mak teh..i can still remember you guys.. ,1

"well it's not the end of the world at all, and in fact by eating smaller lighter meals my stomach is less bloated. i am happily wearing my favourite jeans as a result without the discomfort i had just a week ago, which is great! but the problem is that i have let myself down on some of my basic intentions - i have had alcohol, and a chocolate milkshake, and i have missed a cycling session. i need to do an hour of exercise today or tomorrow to get week one back on track - today i am knackered (from working a bar shift last night) and tomorrow is gonna be a busy day... maybe i should knock the excuses on the head then, actually i think i am talking myself into going for a run. right! new plan for this afternoon - a healthy snack, because i have had no lunch today, just that evil milkshake, then a nap, tidy the flat and then go for a half hour run. wooo! my archives of mens health have revealed some pretty useful info so i'll put that into practice as of next week. in fact the last one i bought had a special feature on 6 packs so i'm going to follow their advice pretty tightly. at the moment i can only see a limited improvement, and absolutely no signs of any muscles. still, it's early days, and i hope that by next wednesday, photo day there will be a detectable difference!

"missed putting out my garbage this morning. i forgot it was middle of the week already. i stopped by the store on the way home last night and got a lot of stuff. for me to eat, and for my party on the 12th of june. not very far away at all now. i finally got a couple pairs of bargan jeans, was down to just 2 pairs, now i have 4 again. i have gotten about $1000 together for buying the new deck materials, but i do not think that is going to be enough. might only be enough to frame it up. oh well, that is better than nothing. working on selling my van, if i can sell it than i will have enough to finish the deck and get a new case to get one of my broken computers running again. after i got home i chatted, watched a few movies, and worked on a program to break apart url's. i watched something about mary, office space and fight club. fight club was a strange movie... if he was the other guy too, who was he fighting when he started up fight club? this morning i woke up late again.

"it is june now. i bought tickets over the weekend to go home for my family reunion and to goto a game convention with my friends. i am glad i live a couple thousand miles away from my relatives, but i still love them and like to see them once a year. the family reunion is when they are on their best behavior. i couldn't sleep last night. ate too late and had bad heart burn. so i was afraid if i fell asleep i would breath in some vomit again. i hate when i do that. i really need to not eat or drink anything after like 8pm. i put a small personal water cooler in at my desk. it will give out 8 cups and keeps the water pretty cold. it will only cool a cup of water every 30 minutes, but that is all i can drink anyway. i hope that if i drink more water then i will drink less soda pop and that seems to be working so far. with any luck i will drop a few pounds and feel better if i drink water instead of just pop all the time. i woke up late and was fuzzy, by the time i goto work it was almost 3pm, the qa guy wasn't happy. skipped out on another meeting, they didn't need me at that meeting anyway.

"went to the auto store and got a battery and new windshield wipers for my van. i removed skin off the side of my left hand, next to my thumb. didn't hurt at the time, but it did hurt later. i also had bought a can of fix a flat for my white prizm car and it half inflated my tire, i drove the car around the neighborhood and felt the tire going down, so i went back home. will have to fix that later. went home and put a bandaid on my hand, then put the windshield wiper blades into the van. i managed to stab my thumb with a wood chisel and it bleed a lot, finally got that washed off and a tiny little bandage on it that stopped the blood flow instantly. drove the van around the neighborhood and back home. i also found a good deal on a paper binding system with those plastic rolls with fingers on them for like half price. so i bound up a bunch of documents, it looks good. i am going to make use of that a lot as i try to organize a lot of documentation about vnos, the program i work on. i also copy a lot of magazine articles that i find useful and those can be binded too.

"i got up and dialed in for the wolfpack meeting. that took a while. lots of changes at work, but they don't seem to affect me much. after the meeting i worked for a couple of hours on making the headless linux port link and load on os x. then i headed over, got license tabs for my van, and decided to finally fix the 12 volt battery in my prius. it had gone dead last year and nothing at the auto store fit, so i put one that was too big in it and hooked it up with jumper cables. toyota wanted $320 for a new battery. yeah, i thought that too. so i went to the store and got more stuff for my party. while i was there i picked up some battery terminals and a few little supplies to try to rig up a perminant solution for the battery in the trunk. that is on hold for a while. looked for a van battery at the store, but they didn't have one the right size. took all my winnings and went home. worked until like 4am that night, finally got a widget to load in headless mac.

where did the weekend go? i spent the weekend debunking a lot of fake claims against f911. sad that people will just manufacture little jabs at it like this. i am only about halfway done breaking apart their point by point criticism of the movie. i figure out that if you take the number of people who approve of the president and minus the number of people that disaprove of the president that this gives you a value between 100 and -100 that pretty much shows what people think of the president at that time. this week sometime i am going to make a pretty web page with graphs of the presidents since kennedy. and one graph that overlays everything. going home now to fix a computer for a friend. ,2

"whoa...it's something that the people don't really expect that things can happen by itself. i am not really scared of that because i am really getting used to it 5-6 times before. here what happened. when i was on the way to the city where i was supposed to help by work cleaning the house with someone, until something went over my head and things did happened really unexpectedly to me. when i drove through the freeway and about to changed the lane to other after checked on my side of pickup. suddenly, i noticed that the truck in front of me was stopped very soon and i cannot expect it to do that and stomped on the brake but it's too late for that. my pickup's front left corner already smashed on the truck's back right corner. the other truck have lil damage but mine was worst. i saw the smoke came out and the antifreeze liquid leaked all over the road. i was like frozen and said ""damn..."" in my mind. my mouth exhaled and inhales outside and inside slowly. you know the route for the car wreck like reporting the police department, write down on other person's driver liscense and car insurance, signed on the wreck report paper down, and so on the list. the state trooper gave me the ticket for getting close to the vehicle that worth $171. big ouch for me. later, the state trooper (st) and me had a chat while we were on the way to drop me off because my dad can picked me up. here what happened is: we chatted by wrote on the paper back and forth. me and state trooper talked about new police radar that have video camera, police speed radar, etc until the special conversation came up. st: how old are you? me: 24 st: do you work? me: no, i have been looking for a job since i graduated from university because the jobs are getting harder and harder to find these days. the state trooper nodded in agreement. st: do you ever had a ticket before? me: honestly, yes. but i hadn't had one for long time until now because i had been drove very carefully. he nodded again. me: but sometime things can happens unexpectedly to anyone. he went hmm and wrote down on the paper st: give me the ticket i went look for it and gave it to him then i was puzzled about that and read what he said to me without write down on the paper. he said ""don't worry about that and i will take care of that."" i was shocked and surprised then write down on the paper me: thank you very much and i am very appreciate with that. i did shook the hand with him and thanked him. see what i mean? i am very lucky enough to getting out of the $171-worth ticket for being honest with the state trooper and did learned the big valuable lesson for telling nothing but truth to the state troopers. sometime the unlucky situation can lead to the lucky day. that's all i have the news for now.

"thanks to dan, last week i got an invitation to attend the prestigious private event of the inaugration of prince phillip as the president of the club of rome brussels chapter, talk about being in the right place at the wrong time, there was about 80 people, everyone seemed to have been one of those great achievers and it was alittle embarrasing having to present exactly who i was.... you should have seen the grin on my face when i met the prince and chatted alittle about aiesec to him, the beautiful thing about it was the fact that these guys are now tired of old blood and the presence of young blood at this ceremony was really encouraging for them !you can catch up with me later for the ""detailed"" side of the story but first let me share with you who these guys are and how wonderfully thought their ideas are. for those of you who dont know, who are ""the club of rome ?? they are a global think tank and centre of innovation and initiative. as a non-profit, non governmental organisation (ngo), they bring together scientists, economists, businessmen, international high civil servants, heads of state and former heads of state from all five continents who are convinced that the future of humankind is not determined once and for all and that each human being can contribute to the improvement of our societies. they aim to work as a global catalyst of change. they do this by taking a global, long term and interdisciplinary perspective aware of the increasing interdependence of nations and the globalisation of problems that pose predicaments beyond the capacity of individual countries. these guys are a bunch of high standing and achieving dons in their field. brushing shoulders with these guys was one of those aha ! experiences for me, the need to master self, the need to use your talent, the need to act and not be acted upon, the need to recognise the power of ""interdependence"" and the need to understand what truly is self actualisation. later, i will share with you thoughts from some great guys i met there !

"today i woke up as usual at 10:30am. being lazy is nothing new to me but today i have a strong spell of laziness and sleep over me. although i am awake, i am just looking for a chance to get under my duvet for a couple of minutes to have a 'tiny' nap. emoji  i guess i will do it, but its going to hurt me a bit as i have lots of stuff to do. i am behind schedule with my disertation. emoji  its not that bad but not that good either. anyways i will do something. but can somebody tell me how to get rid of all this sleep? emoji  see ya later. monazza emoji  :d ",1
"today nothing really happened in my life and i was as lazy as can be. but i saw something on the tv which made my eyes pop out. that something was the person nick griffin, leader of the british national party. his comments were quoted in news which were 'islam is a wicked vicious belief'. he also added several other comments to that. i was so disappointed and sad about this. i was feeling angry at mr griffin. but at the same time i was wondering that how can we, the muslims, portray the real picture of our faith, islam. i think it is partly our fault that we don't show such a character as we should and the true essence of our religion. so people either misunderstand it or just abuse it for the sake of it. islam has been abused long enough. it is high time that all of the muslims should take some action about it. by action i do not mean fighting, but intellectually tackling the problem. i also want to thank mr griffin. becasue when people like him say such things, my belief in my faith grows even stronger. see ya all later. monazza emoji  ",1
"don't think that i am kidding. i litterally did get burnt by ice, or let's say by the freezer. actually i was putting some stuff in the freezer, when suddenly my finger got stuck to the ceiling of the fridge. i pulled it but had to exert a lot of pressure to do that. it felt that i had delibrately put some super glue on my finger to stick it there. anyways, when i finally got it off, it hurt a bit but i didnt notice anything. but after a while it hurt a bit more. when i saw it, it had a small burnt-like wound on it, all pink and a bit swollen. so thats how i got 'burnt by ice'. emoji  ",1
"some time ago, i was quite unaware that what a 'blog' is. but slowly i have come to know of the power of the blog. i had been lazy to start one of my own. but finally today i gathered all my remaining energies to finally go to blogger.com and make myself a blog. i don't know exactly what i will be posting here. but one thing is for sure, that it is going to be about me. :d so keep reading and i will promise to keep 'boring' you with my silly tales. see ya all later. monazza emoji  ",1
"when i was back home in pakistan, i used the phrase 'allah hafiz' (meaning may god keep you safe) to say bye to people. when i came to uk i was a bit confused about what to say. every time i would just stop myself from saying 'allah hafiz' to people. not that i didn't want them to be kept safe by god, but it's just that they wouldn't understand what i was saying. so i had to choose from one of the phrases already used here. some would say 'see ya later', some would say just 'bye'. but i had to mingle the two and choose the phrase 'see ya, bye' for myself. not that i have any complaints about it, but it becomes really hilarious when i am on the phone. whenever someone calls i say 'hi' or 'hello' which is fine. but when i have to say 'bye' i act like a fool. i am so used to saying 'see ya bye' that even on the phone to people who are strangers to me i say 'see ya, bye'. i know that i am not going to see them ever, but still that's the thing which comes to my mind to say and i blurt it out. only after putting down the receiver i realize what i had said. but then i cannot undo anything. already made a fool out of myself i remain a fool. but what i can do is laugh about it, and let the whole world laughwith me too. emoji  ",1
"i talked about bhindi so much that i thought i should put everything related to it in my blog. well the other thing is that i cooked bhindi a day or two ago. i had bought it for many days, but cooking it was actually the attempt to save it from getting rotten in the fridge. emoji  [i haven't even started on my fridge bluesyet] i cooked them. they looked fine. but they suffered the same dilemma as all my cookings suffer. that is the dilemma of 'too much'. sometimes it is the salt that is too much, sometimes the red chilies are too much, some times i cook the stuff too much, and this time with the bhindi it was 'too much tomatoes'. so the food tasted more like tomatoes than bhindi. :p i had cooked some turnips a few days before that, and they suffered the same plight. i really need to learn when to stop, especially with the tomatoes. emoji  ",1
"when i was in pakistan the english translation for 'bhindi' i knew was ladies fingers. whenever i was told this translation i was told that since the shape of 'binds' is likeladies fingers so that's why it is given this name. i used to be fascinated by this fact always, and used to think that it has been named rightly. then i came to uk. here nobody knew about 'ladies fingers'. i was disappointed to see that. 'how can these people not know the name of the vegetable in their own language?', i would say to myself. then i discovered the word 'ocra' and my life was saved. then i wondered that why in the world we, in pakistan, still call it 'ladies fingers'. but then we don't call it that. we call it 'bhindi'. emoji  ",1

"wow today was the first day in about 3 weeks that i didn't wake up with tears running down my face, i woke up with a kitten messing with me to play with it. so i woke up not loving stefanie as much as i did last week which is a good thing, i realize now that she would never do the things i did for her and that she really wasn't in love with me well at one point she had a deep crush... i know this because she would still be with me if she loves me, i don't hate her i'm just realizing what everyone has been telling me for the past 3 weeks that "" if she truly loves you she would be with you now "". i quit trying to make her fall in love with me because i know now that you cant change people. i love her so much and i just want the best for her she doesn't care about me because i know now she is thinking about her grounded boyfriend and not me. i don't want to live life without regrets and i'm not going to because i know i tried with all i had to get her back with me, she just doesn't love me. she says she is confused but if she ""confused"" why is she with him and not with no one? 4 months of complete love she cheated on me twice which yet again proofs she didn't love me that she only thinks about herself, i was just too blind to see it, since when your in love your really really blind. love is great i don't hate it and i hope i will fall in love with someone else again because those 4 months were the happiest of my life. they say you don't know true happiness till you have been in love and that you have never been in true pain till you have lost it. i know for a fact that if she truly loved me like shesaid she didshe is going to realize what she has lost, because i know that i'm betterforher in everyway as a person and as a friend. she truly took me for granted and i know she will be thinking about me when she is 23lol today i woke up with a smile on my face. i know that she might still have a part of my heart but she doesn't have all of it, so i will love again and i will be looking at the stars for another angel to fall down. i might not love that person as much as i loved stefanie but there are going to have to except that if they love me. i might not walk 50 mile for them but i might ride a bike 100 miles what i'm saying is that i'll take love a little bit slower next time and i'll savor the love a little better, i'm not going to just rush into things like i did last time. so i'm smiling, why? because i know i'm still standing even though she completely broke my heart, i'm still here despite how much pain i've been through. i've always said that everyone is here for apurpose for how ever big or small that purpose is. i always try to shine the light in the darkness sort of speak. i'm already starting to like someone which is a good thing,i'm going totry to ask her out on a date as friend, i'm way to shy to do that lol but i'll try doesn't ever hurt to try, right? live life to love and love life to live on and become stronger from your mistakes and wounds. life is a mystery with endless roads and trails. i'm just going to become stronger from all these experiences. i thank vero for trying to tell me this but at the time i was in love and i couldn't see 2 feet in front of me. i'm not going to regret not having stef because i didn't loose her she lost me. i'm so happy and it feels good that she lost and not i, and they say nice guys finish last... ha! i just wanted to say.. thank you for everyone who helped me through this. you all are great friends sorry i didn't mention my most important friend alexa she was my shoulder to cry on. i love you thank you love prevails over all...

"seeing as the election year is getting heated with all of the anti-bash bush propaganda (e.g. fahrenheit 9/11), and now the merger of two very wishy-washy liberals running for president and v.p., i feel compelled to post this article that i found. now, remember (and this is reiterated at the bottom of the article), you cannot believe everything you read on-line, see on t.v., and hear on the radio...if you want to be a voter that has a clue about what is going on come this november's election i suggest you do your own research. jeff's thoughts on michael moore and fahrenheit 9/11 including links to the anti-moore web sites it's unfortunate, but many people will use farenheit 9/11 as their election education, and do no further reading or research. they will watch this film, pass judgement on bush, the war in iraq, and the war on terrorism. they will decide who they are going to vote for based on two hours or so in a movie theater. this scares me. ... .. it scares me because it's not fair to anyone. if you are basing all you know on a particular subject from one movie, one radio show, one news program, or one newspaper article. .. then you don't know enough! personally, i give michael moore credit for creating a work that everyone is talking about, however i have to stop there. he created a piece of fiction and labeled it a documentary and put it out there for mass consumtion. idiotic and dangerous. i hope someday he is ashamed, but somehow i doubt his ego will ever allow that. the above paragraph is my opinion. i base that opinion on lots of reading and research. however, i have not yet seen the film. i will see it in the near future so i can more properly challenge it. please know that my thoughts or opinions may change after seeing the film and gaining more knowledge, and if that occurs, i will share with you on the air and here. in the meantime, educate yourself -- regardless of your opinion of michael moore. here are some links i have found useful: the official movie site: _urllink_ michael moore's official site: _urllink_ a usa today article about the movie. if you are short on time, just scroll down and read the notes in the box on the left-hand side: _urllink_ the lies of michael moore: _urllink_ exactly what it says: _urllink_ a watchdog site that uncovers lies and exagerations distribued by michael moore: _urllink_ the mis-truths of michael moore's other recent movie: _urllink_ please remember, don't automatically believe everything you read on these web pages, watch on tv, or hear on the radio. take time to learn about the news and issues on your own. read! learn! make your own decisions and don't follow the herd. .. question, challenge, and don't stop until you are comfortable with the knowledge you have gained.

"the legendary tyler durden once said to me, ""it's only when you have lost everything that you're free to do anything."" i never looked too much into it. it never occured to me that words from a self-destructive imsomniac would make pretty much sense in my life. but then later i realised why he is such a legend. i had a vision. not really another ""project mayhem"" but it would still be as destructive. to me at least. this is one vision that i am pretty much sure would really make it for me. it's about my future. my destiny. what is to come out of me. but as great stories go, there are choices to take. and also sacrifices to be made. nobody have to die for me, mind you. but being on a journey that's set up for you with free petrol to boot, changing destinations means all the privileges taken. you might end up walking the rest of your journey. no guts, no glory. i've been blinded by my vision. i can almost see my destination, and it feels very near. i thought, even if i got lost, i sure can learn a thing or two. so i taken my choice, i changed lane. definitely made the sacrifice too. a big sacrifice i would say, as i was walking barefooted. it's a long journey. no breathtaking scenery. i got lost too, and learnt it the hard way. my life has changed. that is when tyler's words become clear to me. i've lost almost everything. but i'm free. free of the burden that's been thrust upon me. i am no longer under the obligations that others expect of me. now i can go anywhere i want. doing whatever i feel like doing. i'm getting somewhere. set my own future. i'm going to make it. no turning back. i had more visions now. some are crisp clear. some seems blurry. i'm already somewhere, but the visions kept me going. don't really know where's the next stop, but i trust my visions. even the blurry ones. or maybe it's just some illusions, and i'm delusive. but so was tyler durden.

"i hate school! i hate school then and i hate school now. always has been. i don't really have anything against anybody that loves to go to school, but to me school is overrated. actually it's not the idea that going to school and learn things that bother me. i mean i like to learn something new. everyday i learn new things. but not in school. nothing really interests me in school. nothing much to learn too. the teachers, do they really teach you? i mean the things you really want to know, they teach you that? or they just quote something from the text book and give you tons of homework? not that i get punished for not doing it everytime (managed to escape occasionally), but it seems that is the thing teachers look up to, every single day. most teachers also have biased view of the students. the girls are likely to be on the good graces, while the boys, no matter how good, is considered a nuisance to the class. do they try to make their class interesting? do they even know that the students no longer able to concentrate after 15 minutes? why is it wrong for the students to adapt to their own style to learning? why the students have to copy pages of notes that is already in the text book? then comes the revision books, is it really neccessary to buy? why even bother with the tuition anyway? i know i'm not the best in my class. but i am still in the top ten most of the time. thats quite an achievement for someone that hardly pays attention in class and always in a dispute with the teachers. i haven't had any good rapport with my teachers. they always feel they are right to instruct me to do things, whereas i tend to question them. i don't go to school to have someone boss me around! the learning process is supposed to be much more simpler and fun than what they perceive. in the end, i made my decision.. i quit! never liked school anyway. school made me feel stupid. and probably will make me stupid. too stupid to even do my own thinking. i don't want that. i'd rather learn things on my own. and i did. come to think of it, are they really smart after all- the guys who went to school and have no idea what they really learnt? after all what they know probably just the things that are in the text book. how many can think for themselves? how many made full use of the things they learnt in school? take a look around, see if you can see what i mean. now, who are you calling stupid?

"plath once said that she refused to write about the rain because it seemed like anytime there was a storm, a million poems about the rain would flood into journals and magazines the following week. thats peculiar and so i guess i won't comment on the weather today other than for some strange reason it reminds me of my last summer in puerto rico. although it never really rained there, we had so many sun showers, where it would drizzle for a bit but the sun would be shining. it was just enough rain to cool the hot afternoon sun and left this sort of crip, clear smell, like the ocean smells. i guess i am talking about the rain, ok ill stop. isn't it funny how you can be so close to someone at a point in your life and years later, you wonder what you would have in common with them if you were to meet for the first time now? thats happened to me alot recently and for some reason those people always leave me feeling like somehow i've changed and its such a tragedy. and i wonder, how can you not change? since high school, since college...and if you haven't changed, have you really experienced anything new, anything different, anything at all? instead of welcoming change, we shy away from it, like at some point in our lives we were so perfect and anything that deviates from that is somehow terrible. i don't want to presume to ever be perfect so as not to allow myself to invent and reinvent myself and maybe along the way i'll somehow find my trueness. but it seems like ""change"" is viewed in such a negative way, like "" oh, you've changed "" but if i were always the same, what would be the fun in that? change is a great thing, just like a rain storm after a beautiful sunny weekend--so if you're bummed by the rain, how will we ever have flowers if it doesn't rain?

"""don't limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another time.""~rabbinical saying i said good-bye to manix last night because he's leaving for thailand this afternoon for a whole month. for some reason it was the hardest thing for me to do. i kept telling him how much i'm going to miss him and he responded ""i'll miss you too."" but for some reason, i don't think he gets just how much i'll miss him. i never really thought i would get this way about him, especially since hes not even my own child but oddly enough i guess it really doesn't matter. recently he's been saying phrases like ""what do you think you're tough?"" (when we wrestle) and although at first i laugh because its funny coming from him, i actually was a bit taken back by how much he's grown. when i first met him, he was this tiny lil three-year old who couldn't tie his own shoes and now he's a six year old who travels more than anyone else i know. suddenly i feel old. i feel like i'm saying and feeling all these things that my parents say and feel about us. this lil guy has become such a huge part of my life its scary. its scary to feel these emotions for someone else, let alone someone else's child. it makes you feel so vulnerable and sometimes when he's going away i find myself thinking things like ""make sure you don't forget the sunscreen or his sunglasses"" and i bite my tongue with a sudden realization that i'm not his mother or father. manix has taught me so much about myself and about life in general. he's taught me that its okay to get your feathers ruffled once in awhile, patience (he's just a kid), acceptance, humility (when he often seems to ask better questions than me), to be curious (its okay not to know everything), to laugh more, to play tag, to giggle, to hug, to blow cootie kisses, to take risks, to try new things, to be less selfish, to share, to be honest, to treat people like i want to be treated (not to talk down to him just because he's a kid), to take time out because life really is too short, to.....love unconditionally.

"for some reason everytime that i move out of the house it seems like the first. when i moved out for college it tore apart my lungs and i felt alone and i had this gaspy feeling like i was breathing underwater. its strange, maybe that was the same feeling that brought me back home during law school but once again i have choosen to leave them or maybe they have made the choice for me. i spent last night just lying in bed thinking about them and about chiku and feeling this intense sense of gratitude for having the life that i have. looking back it seems like there was never a time that i felt i lacked something, be it material or theoritical. sometimes i wish dad had been around more but had that been the case, we might still be living in india and i might not be feeling the way i do now. he is by far one of the most amazing men in this world. i know that everyone says that kinda stuff about their dad but sometimes i really feel like he's unreal. by far the most open-minded, free- thiking person i know. his creativity and courageousness is uncanny; how many people can drop everything at the age of 40 and move their whole life to a foreign country and be left with no roots? i can't do that at 23 let alone at 40! as for mom, i am so fu(king amazed at how shes done it. raising us two by herself with dad gone most of the time, her career and well just about everything else. for all those times that i resent her for not letting me go, whatever that means, there are an infinte more times that she has been the most amazing woman that i have ever met. her strength, her independence (of mind also), her resiliance, her rebelious spirit, her beauty. finally, chiku. where can i even being except that i really think we were suppose to be twins. i feel like he understands me better than anyone in this world and even more importantly, he accepts me with all my faults and hangups. he has been my constant through everything and i wish sometimes he knew just how much i love him. by far the most articulate, creative, radical, humble, talented, knowledgable person that i know. i can go on forever, but in short-your family is all you really got and with them, ive got it all.

"ok, kerry has truly lost touch, lets see this is what he wants to do. in a speech he gave today, he stated, if he was elected president and usama was captured by us forces alive, he would make sure he got a fast and speedy trial here in the united states, where he would see that he was tried for the murders in nyc, penn, and washington dc. wait a minute, i can here johnny cochran just beginning to count his money he would get from all the usama sympathizers, hell he would probably try it pro-bono just to get the book deal, and his face all over the big screens across the world. but here is the case as it would unfold, johnny would prove with out a doubt usama was not on the planes, us intelligence is classified therefore not able to be used in court and completely circumstantial, and finally usama was really misunderstood and suffered years of oppression from the west, it was our fault he turned out to be a fanatic, he really meant no harm in his statements to his underlings. god what a moron, so here is the deal, if usama is found, shoot him dead, cut of his head and air it every arabic tv station. below is the link to the article, just so everyone knows i am not making it up, and it is not a black helicopter theory, its not a fox news site, or any other site of a vast right wing conspiracy, it is simply the ap. urllink _urllink_ ",1

"so guess what, sometime last night, after watching the dnc i am sure, so low life varmint decide that our hammock we had outside was being neglected and decided to borrow it without returning it. got to love america, since we are ""rich"" ie rich being defined as having something that other people don't have since the george bush was unable to provide it, (note during the clinton years theft most not have occurred because a democrat was in office. hold the phone, this is a real time discovery, emily (my girlfriend for those who don't know), went outside around behind our garage and discovered the varmint was unable to carry it over the fence that was bent over and left it there to rest, so it looks like we are going to have to throw some razor wire back there to deal with the problem. damn, maybe not, because if i do that, and an unexpecting criminal happens to cut himself (or herself, gotta be pc, not gender biased), then its my fault and i will get sued by a lawyer much like the kind of lawyer john edwards. so whats the next step, cops in my neighborhood will not patrol (station says they need to get more tickets written for speeding, catching thieves and deterring crime only costs the station house money ). what next, maybe i should sit in my back yard with a large assault rifle and just ""defend my property"", at any rate cops are useless since they don't patrol, everyone knows there is not a police presence anywhere, so what better thing to do. note this is not an isolated incident, before i moved in, and we were living out of my apartment, we had some nice kind soul, kick down our door, just a few weeks ago another nice individual borrowed my gas grill (with out returning it). so what to do!

"yaaaaaawwwnnnnnnn is about all i can really say when thinking about it. hell, even dan rather thinks this is so boring. so what happened to the conventions? once upon a time, the conventions was a place where all the delegates of each state would sort through pressing issues of the time and nominate the person they see fit, now what is it, a freaking joke! all they do is put on there pretty hats, censor all the speeches to be more ""moderate"" and less anti-bush. the entire world has known for months that kerry is the democrats guy, why waste all the money, why shut down an entire city for absolutely nothing, and don't get me wrong this all will directly apply to the rnc as well. the legitimacy is long gone of these things, i am not sure why they even cover it, hell on monday, with all the heavy hitters, both clintons, al gore etc speaking, nobody watched and it was on every channel, expect for one, where a lone rerun of csi:miami was on, which according to the ratings, everyone was watching. another quick note, these people don't care about kerry, edwards, al gore, the clintons, in fact the only time people there get excited is the few anti-bush statements that were permitted by the dnc. did anyone else notice that 1/2 the seats there was unfilled, even when bill and hillary was speaking? kinda strange for a big time convention, maybe they where trapped in a cage match in the free speech zone!

"yes, my neighbor's rule! ok, so this family up the street from my house was letting their kids play in their pick up truck (with the keys) which is parked on the street. so guess what, as if you didn't already know, the car was placed into neutral and rolled and crushed another car a few houses down that is also parked on the street. so, guess whose fault this accident was, was it the neighbor's down the street who should not have parked their car on the street? was it the children in the car who the parents gave them the keys to the truck? or was it the parents of the kids who allowed their kids to play in the truck that rolled and crushed the other neighbor's truck on the street? i am guessing none of the above, it really is the fault of president george w bush, since he has failed to provide education to our kids. it is more likely the fault of halliburton and dick cheney as well, its all a conspiracy, had bush been on top of things he would make sure those children were safe, he would make sure they knew how to drive the vehicle before getting into it, had he properly passed legislation to do so this would not have happened, in fact gw should write my neighbor's a check tonight. hopefully john edwards won't get wind of this, he may attempt to sue the city for not putting in safety devices on the street, as well as suing the manufacture of the truck, since the truck should not be able to go into drive or neutral with the key in the ignition...how freaking absurd!!!!

"yet neil continues with a great addition of neil nuze at urllink www.boortz.com read and enjoy: one of the centerpieces of the democratic stump speech these days has been that 'bush lied.' the loony left likes to say that bush 'misled the country.' i've been trying for months now to get just one caller to tell my vast (but not vast enough) audience just what lie bush told us. so far, no luck. it's a lot easier to run around saying that bush lied than it is to actually come up with an example*. still, even thought mountains of evidence, along with two reports by the british and united states governments, exonerate the president, it's still a rallying cry for the left. in case you come across one of these weirdoes, let's examine the evidence.david kay, the leader of the iraq survey group, speaking about the intelligence said there was ""no sign that the administration pressured analysts."" then there was the bipartisan senate intelligence committee which completely absolved the administration of any lying. over in great britain, something called the butler report found no evidence that prime minister tony blair misled anyone. then, there's the 9/11 commission, which found that the administration was misled by a flawed intelligence network. and finally, even hans blix himself said who said ""i don't think they acted in bad faith.""so why do people keep repeating the fantasy that ""bush lied?"" because their hatred of george w. bush is so deep, they fail to see the facts (something liberals don't like anyway.)next time somebody tells you bush lied, ask them to prove it. they won't be able to. *remember, a statement can only be a lie if you knew that statement to be untrue at the time you made it. if i tell you that i'm going to take paul's phone call right after the break, and paul hangs up during the break, i can't be tagged with a lie.

"urllink sarahbeth's photo gallery the cat, she caught a baby bunny last night and his head was ripped clean off like a beheaded promise that someone might have once made. the guts of everything comes out the neck of the thing in the end, and just like that in the soft glow from the porch light i see the intricacies and false hopes in the body of the promise, that the poor thing's heart was only the size of my thumb anyway, and ""i will"" and ""i love you"" are less than the size of a pinkie. his and my fingers have always been the undoing. i shouldn't have let the cat out to do their dirty work, i know it, but she is a predator after all, and she (and he) just slipped right out the screen door through my legs, i had no control, it wasn't my fault, i swear it. i meant just to let them be free for a moment, because they were climbing the walls and started scratching and biting and giving me all sorts of hell, bruises they said were accidental and look what's happened now. like someone else i maybe once knew, maybe i still know him, maybe he just doesn't ever want anyone to know him because he thinks it is too ugly, his bloodlust, his need to feed off other living beings. he and the cat need to destroy in order to live. and now they're both stuck indoors most times and so are therefore forced to destroy little bits of themselves instead to protect life surrounding them. there are so many pieces missing by now. i still find fur on my pillow. so when they get out of their self imposed prisons, watch out. you're not safe, even hiding quietly in trees. i should know. i had become very skilled at climbing trees. and still...they will find you and when they catch you, they will bring you in front of everyone like a trophy, carrying your limp but beautiful body in their mouths, and all the other cats will think you such a delicious catch and be so jealous of him and her, oh were they ever jealous. they will say the bunny was already killed maybe, that other cats have caught her, that she was a weak bunny, she is a controlling and convoluted bunny, she had a lame leg, it will never last, cat, so give it up. they know the cat has hunting problems, oh so many problems, that the poor thing has never before this caught anything worth eating, and yet their envy is so great, they just can't encourage him to be happy with the hunt. they must convince him there are better bunnies. that maybe no bunny will ever be enough. that he must prowl alone. i suspect they secretly wanted the bunny for themselves...or for him to leave it for the coyotes to claim, because after all, the cat's catch makes all of their mice and moles look so paltry. he slayed the bunny last night and my head went rolling into the woods. clean off. he says he won't he won't he refuses to do so simply because i asked, like a child who will not go to bed, will tell you he is not sleepy, nope, not sleepy and passes out cold on his blanket five minutes later. and the moment gets lost. that damn child missed out on his bedtime story because he was too stubborn to let me tuck him in. lost in dreams now, running outside to play with imaginary friends, i suspect the cats have convinced him it's for the best. the bunny wasn't worth it. and when they all bring their moles and insects and mice and birds in front of him, parade their catches with puffed out chests, he will feel a twinge, maybe an ache, maybe even a stabbing pain of regret. and my head will be rolling. a trophy, maybe the best catch ever, is lost to pride. damn that cat and his pride. for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1

"some people liken human behavior to animal behavior. i've just moved and after having spent a bit of time digging and planting, i liken it more to plants. some people are roses. they need lots of sun and water and to be the spotlight of the garden, but they are easy to figure out. they are ordinary, really. maybe pretty, but ordinary. i know lots of daisies and lilies, cute but a bit predictable, and i know some unfortunate creeping phlox, that comes back year after year, and looks beautiful at first but drowns out anything around it eventually. like ivy. even if it's not poison. especially if it's not poison. it's ground cover and it does its job and everyone thinks it beautiful while it quickly creeps and strangles everything around it. ivy becomes something no one can control at this point, and it hides snakes and ticks within and suffocates other life beneath, and moves up walls and big old brick houses, eating the mortar from the inside out. i've always thought the idea of flowers can be so sad, just like people you love and lose, that you can plant and tend to them and spend years watching them become something of beauty, a place to sit under and enjoy the shade, and one week of inattention, one season of freezing weather, one small factor can kill the entire living thing. and it's gone. just like that. the gardener is heartbroken. devastated. everything she did, all the nights she ran outside barefoot with blankets to protect it from the cold, the hot blistering days she spent snipping back disease, the days she decided to forgo the fast fresh cut flowers in favor of looking at the prospects in the back yard...and just like that, the plant gives in to mother nature. and i see it dying. and there's nothing i can do anymore. for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1
"i think i have book editing to the brain. i need to refocus here. but before i do... - i am going over this book, right now, book # 2, this book that will be my next release, this book i admittedly really do love and always have, this book i wrote years ago actually and i am finding the most eerie, unnerving coincidences in it to my very recent life with characters i wrote about who i now know. i feel like a clairvoyant, where i write about people who i then come to meet later. if people who are close to me didn't know that i had written this book years ago, they would think some of it was based on truth. this has happened before this book with other things i've written. so i of course worry it might happen after this book, which makes me want to write next about the most kind, forgiving, loving people who surround me with sunshine and rainbows. okay, maybe not that far, but you get the picture. there are far too many prophecies come true in this one. the sex of the character might be different, or the exact circumstance, but it's just strange. maybe i've just been staring at the computer screen too long. who knows. -i want to personally, right now, thank bonnie, who bid on and won an autographed copy of my book on the urllink peta auction held recently (some of which is still going on, featuring stella mccartney among others). all of that money is going to a very worthy, very important cause, and i want to thank you personally for your interest in both the animals and in little old me. your book, i hear, is on its way. -i miss some things right now. some things i don't miss. i can't decide sometimes which parts are worth missing and which parts need to be exorcised. do you ever feel like you are having an out of body experience all the time? that's the way i've always felt. sometimes i come home late at night and just sit on the front stoop of my house for a minute before i go inside and i look out at the rabbits playing in my yard and the flowers and i breathe the summer air and i think on all the fortunate opportunities i've had in my life, it all feels like enough maybe. then other times i sit at night on my little deck in the back and stare into the darkness of the bushes and trees and i see lightning bugs, these bugs that used to make me so happy and excited and i just wonder...what happened to everything? what is missing? there's this piece. and i can't seem to find it lately. the words are really on my side tonight with the manuscript i'm editing, so i must go again. i am going back to the book i love. the other things that maybe i once had or that are just plain missing... hopefully they'll come in time. urllink colorado holiday pictures urllink what authors do when they're not writing? for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1
"home again...listening to tom petty. trying to catch up on edits for book number two. i have promised myself i will finish them in record time with startlingly fantastic results. hmmm...overachiever much? ""somewhere, somehow somebody must have kicked you around some tell me why you wanna lay there and revel in your abandon?"" tom petty is america's best songwriter, hands down, and that includes all those overrated artists anyone mentions. dylan, springsteen, lennon. come on. get off the bandwagon already. petty has for longer than anyone in at least fifty years written poignant lyrics, along with the best damn rock 'n roll music around. he is not bitter or jaded, he is not in victoria's secret commercials (ahem) he has not used causes or sex or martyrdom or what critics have to say to boost his appeal, he doesn't flit around in leather pants and frou-frou hair-dos, he isn't an overdramatic, overly sensitive, whiny artist, he isn't a diva, he doesn't expect everyone to forgive him of bad performances or tantrums, he doesn't jump on bandwagons and he has never acted like the world owed him anything. he is the consummate professional. i have seen him perform live countless times with not one ""off"" night. and he doesn't give a shit what you think. he is a rock 'n roll star, but more importantly, he is a talented artist with a great voice and better sense and resiliency than critical darlings and the next big things. and for some reason, i thought that should be said. also, i have returned from a holiday of sorts that included the whole spectrum of adventure. feel free to peruse the photo diary below to see for yourself. i must get back to work. must create...must write and like the results...must eat at some point and remember to water plants...must finish edits...must finish edits... urllink sarahbeth's recent photos for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1
"fahrenheit 911 : saw itthe other day with boyfriend. everyone should see the proof of the other side to the lies we've been told for so long. we were both so disturbed after watching it, we couldn't sleep. san francisco: went a few weeks back to visit boyfriend while he was touring on west coastfor a mini-vacation and to sign some books while i was there. i've been there before, but now i remember why i don't go often. it was cold, rainy, overpriced, dirtier than any city i've ever been to (except maybe nuevo laredo, but close), the traffic and parking and drivers are terrible...no offense to san franciscans, but the city needs a major overhaul. i did get to see the old castle my parents lived in during the seventies with a bunch of crazy rockstars and i did meet a fan of the musician my boyfriend was playing with at the independent club who was totally sweet. he wanted to get a photo with me and proceeded to tell me that i was a ""total package"" being a writer and ""intelligent,beautiful, and friendly""and so on, which was very sweet, especially coming from a guy who has a boyfriend. not trying to get me in bed (obviously) hehad no reason to kiss my ass, so it was a well received compliment. sometimes when you're cold and tired and feeling a bit droopy, compliments will get you everywhere, darling. ocoee :went whitewater rafting and camping at ocoee, tnin boyfriend's '76 vw vanagon for his birthday a few days ago. i fell out of the raft at thebroken nose rapids. i did not break my nose, though. thankfully. i am a kick-ass camper, i must say. this is not a love song : the new book...still working on edits. i hope to finish very soon. love is the drug, the paperback: will be out february 2005. got a sneak peek at the new cover concept from my editor last week. it is very different from the first one....stay tuned. lots of cooking: -wilted spinach with lemon and garlic and a little olive oil -quiche with a potato crust and sundried tomatoes, onions, veggie bacon and gruyere and romano cheese -my favorite comfort meal: vega chicken noodle casserole and none of it compares to my mother's tomato spice dressing. i could pour that stuff over a hairbrush and eat it. reading: do it! let's get off our but's (still...very involved, but very good), tao te ching thinking: about lots of things...summer is nice but then there is that depressing transitional time that happens right before back to school where it's still very warm butyou know it won't be long before the wind starts up, the mornings get cooler, the evenings sometimes get downright cold, flowers and leaves die, and things start to change. things always change , don't they? why, after this long in my life of being constantly ripped out of the ground and transplanted and rearranged, always the changes are still the hardest? even just seasons, just that simple change gets to me. i just sometimes wish that for a little while longer i could count on things, anything really,to remain the same. john kerry: i'm impressed. if you didn't see his speech at the democratic national convention, go to his website ( urllink _urllink_ ) and read his views and policies. no matter who you plan to vote for, you can't deny his importance in the race. ebay: still love it. i have bought and sold the weirdest crap on there. anyone want a half-used bottle of lotion that i don't like the smell of anymore? (just kidding...) sleep : the best drug on earth. root canals : with root canal number six now under my belt, i am officially an old pro at this. today they sealed it all up now that the infection is loweredand put a stainless steel temporary on. the gums are bloody and swollen,my jaw is sore, and i can't chew on that side until my ""new"" tooth comes in (isn't that strange...""comes in""...arrives on a truck of some sort and then is cemented in my mouth??) two more weeks of right side eating. hereditary health and dental issues suck. just random thoughts to keep me occupied. that's what life is about, i suppose. for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1
"i'm singing carpenters tunes in my head. pharmaceuticals aretrickling through my body, and yes, they are prescribed, and no, i am not a pill popper. i don't like feeling out of it like this at all. i am due for dental surgery tomorrow and currently am trying to maintain a straight face while there is throbbing pain in my right upper jaw. i went to the dentist bright andearly this morningand after she took x-rays and found the source of the pain, she setup an endodontist appointment for tomorrow afternoon. the endodontist performs root canals every day, all day. that's all they do. they will shoot my gums with novacaine,drill my tooth open, saw it down to a nub, scrape out all the diseased pulp, and fill it with fake pulp stuff, push tiny pins into the root system to make sure the roots are filled, push those pins in and out, in and out, while they make this sort of ""eee-ahh-eee-ahh"" noise that makes me think of squeaky clean tupperware just washed, and then put on a temporary tooth until my dentist fits me for a crown a few weeks later. because of the placement of the tooth and because my roots are small and hard to get to and basically knarly and require special attention (i've had 3 root canals in one othertooth before) and because i have no health insurance (because i am an author and therefore self-employed and therefore health insurance is ridiculously expensive for people like me, and don't even get me started on how much i hate the fact that people who need healthcare the most do not usually get it and how much this country needs an organized form of healthcare and dental care) and because the tooth is basically screwed beyond repair and i do not want it pulled (because then it will mess up all my other teeth and so on and so forth), i am going to a specialist tomorrow to scrape out all the insides and make a new internal root system and then back to my dentist to put on a fake tooth and pretend it never happened. i have done this before. this is not new to me. having a root canal: about $2,000 bucks getting rid of this pain: priceless actually, i don't know about the priceless part. do you know what you can do with $2000.00? especially if you stretch it out? i keep thinking of tempurpedic beds i want and another touch up lasik surgery and trips to aruba and how i don't really (forgive me) even know where aruba is. i keep wishing i had perfect teeth that never required this sort of special attention. i am getting very personal here, i know, but i think a lot of people can relate. maybe it's just the painkillers talking but...dentistry is nice and all, but what did we do before all of this technology? no one cared if they had crooked teeth or only two teeth. it was part of the human condition. who else thinks it's abnormal to keep a dead tooth and fill it in with cement and cover it with a fake tooth to pretend it still serves a purpose? i have also realized over a few days time that no matter how adult you are about something, no matter how you let things go, over and over again, no matter how zen and forgiving you are, no matter how you try to remedy situations by being kind and facing them, by doing what is right, by being graceful and forthright, some people are just poisonous. there are people in the world who are so soulless, so empty and full of lies andenvious and hateful, that they will always try to damage anyone they encounter who is better off out of spite. they know they will never be repaired, so they try to destroy anything good in their path. i tried recently, after too much time of beingassaulted by a poisonousone of thesesorts,(as small as the assault was, because she matters so little in the general scheme of things) to be an adult, to try to see the humanity in someone else, to reach out a hand and be the bigger person, and i got what i knew she had inside. more poison. i would feel sorry for this vessel of negativity if i thought she had a soulinside to pity. instead, i am left with the truth. there is nothing there, and so there is nothing to feelsorry for. those close to me, especially the one who loves me most know this to be the case already. i had been warned before. they manage to maintain a safe distance. they don't let her know what they know about her, and so i believe she thinks she has allies in them. i had been told about her insanity, her jealously, her unbelievable dysfunctions, and still i suppose i wanted to believe that every human being had a purpose. but now i realize that some people are just here to waste oxygen and try to cause problems. andit was merely human of me to defend myself afterconstant unwarrantedhatefulness, but when i did, when i confronted the beast andwanted to understand a reasoning for the hideous and childish behavior she displays, i also realized, after being reminded by the one who loves me that these types are useless to try and be adult with. you can't argue with crazy. this kind is so menial, thatisn't my problem.let her be a flea on a dog somewhere else. i've got better things to swat at. i'm sure i'll have to run into her again at some point in the near future, but now i feel satisfied. now i understand. i can smile at her the next time she or a kind like her are trying to suck the life out of the room, and i now know that whatever happens, you can eithercomplain about the stench or you canstay away from trash. i'm babbling a bit, i know, and it is probably that these tooth soothers are also a bit of truth serum and maybe i feel strongly enough about what i learned to share it with you, because we all have had the misfortune to meet people like this. the moral of this story is: this kind, these moral prostitutes need not bother you. they self destruct on their own. pay attention to more important matters. bottom feeders like this will live the rest oftheir miserable lives eating their ownshit in the murky depths, while if you stay as far away as possible,you will continue to swim to the top...where life is going on. for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1
"writing. that's what i've been doing if anyone asks. not going out all the time or hanging out by the tv watching soap operas, i have been really really focusing on the new book and editing my little butt off. this is not a love song this will most likely be the title. not let it bleed, as once planned. i really like the new title. people keep calling and inviting me out. people i want to hang out with. things i want to do. but i can't. i'm in a zone. i only stopped a minute ago to write this, because i want to update readers on what's going on in the process. that is, after all, the real reason i keep this online diary. i'm not interested in telling everyone and anyone who wants to know every detail about my personal life,(and obviously from what you've read in my blogger i don't). moreso, the blogger is here because when i like something someone writes or created in some form, i want to know a little about the artist's process, their experiences, maybe a little about them in the artistic sense. i don't want to know their dirty laundry. just maybe more about how they create. so that's what i'm trying to do here, right?!? i am very very happy with what i'm working with here on the new book. so excited about it. one of my friends recently said the coolest thing about my writing. he said he liked my work a lot, because it was like architecture. that it was building up to create something larger. pretty good line, huh? he is a songwriter and has some pretty damn good lines himself in his songs, so i am flattered. architecture is apparently his favorite pastime, the study of it, and so on. so if my work reminds him of his favorite thing, that's a very very nice compliment. i really do need to go. i'm sorry. i just have to finish this. for atom enabled feed, click here: urllink atom feed ",1

(such as looking after my insane old mother, having a succession of crap jobs that didn't pay enough, and other wrist-slittingly depressing reasons i won't bore you with here.) i've been trying to find information about the places to stay and where to play over in ronneby, but can't find much on the web. i've no intention of just hanging about the hotel if there's an intersting rock formation or two nearby, and as my boss phil will also have itchy feet i'll have someone to go 'ooh' and 'aah' will at all the new stuff they'll be to see. of course, my camera will be coming along, so expect lots of pictures of hairy beasts and pretty flowers on this here blog in the latter part of june.

"anthony is a busy guy on mondays. you can tell by the way he wanders around the office with a disgruntled look on his face. anthony is another reporter at the rocky mountain house mountaineer, and monday is production day, so it's busy. i often wonder if all his wandering is really him planning out the quickest possible way to kill everyone. he counts his steps, and looks for problem areas. where would the resistance come from? where is the best and most likely place to reload? is a nice circle route the best or would a quick in and out straight line be appropriate? could he make it out the back door before the cops get to the paper? i'm sure he's clocked out how long it takes to drive from the police station the mountaineer. then it happens. snap! anthony pulls his gun out of his camera bag. we all thought it was a nikon d-100. it turned out to be an ak-47. bullets spray the office. two secretaries are left for dead. little bloody holes appear on their bodies. the remaining employees panic. they yell and scream. the loudest cry comes from the desk in the corner, by the window. dane didn't believe today could be the last of his life. the only problem anthony didn't foresee was joel nielsen: disorientedman. he stumbles into the office with the first cries for help. anthony, with his gun, tries and shoot the superhero. unfortunately, the dom's movements are unpredictable. one minute he's lurching to the right and the next moment he's face first on the ground. there's no way to anticipate the dom's actions. ""ssstoppp,"" slurs the dom, spittle flies from his mouth as he unknowingly exaggerates his p in stop. anthony lets out a laugh. he has no idea the ass kicking he's going to get. ""doon't u laffff at meeee,"" the dom utters as he crashes into the photocopier. a gush of blood erupts from his forehead. ""eowwww."" blood stings the dom's eyes. his vision blurs, which doesn't help the double vision he already has. ""you stupid drunk bastard. get out of here before you kill yourself,"" anthony states. he points his gun at the dom and makes a threatening face. it's really scary. ""i'mm not druunkk. i'm just disoriented, man,"" responds joel nielsen with dom written on his chest. the reek of rye is on his breath and urine stains his pants. it's been a rough day of disorienting people at the local strip club. the dom is starting to realize his tolerance to his rye transformation solution is increasing. he'll have to increase his dosage to doubles. it won't belong before he's downing triples. bang! anthony fires his gun. disorientedman can't stand up straight and falls over to his left, narrowly eluding the bullet. ""hold still you piece of shit,"" yells anthony, frustrated with the dom's inability to stay still. in the corner of the office, hidden under his desk another superhero is about to make an appearance. bang! a second shot. a second miss. anthony lets loose a ferocious scream of frustration. the dom falls to the ground and covers his ears. ""whaaatt de helll waas thhat?"" asks joel's alter ego, as we grabs his flask of serum and downs a little. he gets to his feet after two failed attempts. in the corner, a mask is pulled over a face. anthony lets loose a couple rounds. a bunch more employees are bloodied up. the dom reacts. he falls forward straight onto anthony's shoes. just enough to hold anothony in one spot. a death cry errupts from the corner of the room. ""oh my god, it's the guy with the abilities of a dung beetle,"" stu proclaims. it was earlier in the week stu won a celebrity look alike contest for his brent butt impersonation. ""yes it is i. dungbeetleguy."" dbg runs over to anthony and pushes him against the wall. he rolls anthony into a ball. the sounds of bones snapping can be heard by the radio station upstairs. dbg finally quits rolling anthony into a bloodied pulp. he wakes the dom up. the dom passed out as soon as his head his the carpet. evil was vanquished and a new superhero duo formed. a pair that could rival clark kent and superman, weed and rob, dave and bob, peanut butter and jam on bread. villains beware! rocky mountain house has a pair of crime fighters who aren't smart enough to get out of your way. with the dom as the peanut butter and dbg as the jam, they're going to make one tasty sandwich.

"joel advised me about prey for rock and roll. he said gina gershon supposedly sucked. she did. the movie did and i'm pissed off i sat through the entire thing. if a movie has a hot girl with a tight leather outfit on the cover, it should have some nudity. the movie needed something. at least showgirls knew enough to put naked girls in the film. the back cover of prey for rock and roll even mentions a sexy thrill ride. there was no sex, no thrill and i've had better rides on donkeys. i did however watch dumb and dumberer. it was funny. not as good as the first but decent. i would recommend it to friends, but only watch it once. after that, it becomes stupid. the jokes aren't funny after the one time. the actors are very similar to jim carey and jeff daniels, but they're not the same. watch it though. it's stupid, but puts a smile on your face. now i'm back to thinking up schemes to keep the ladies away from joel.

""he's a nuisance and he'll be back."" i'm starting to understand the 3-strike rule in california. we need to put some fear into the criminals again. the death sentence doesn't stop people from killing, but i'm sure it has decreased the numbers. anyway, ivan left the courtroom smiling. he has no respect, so why should the average citizen who actually obeys society's rules? i'm also trying to figure out the relationship between the population of natives in the area and the number that appear in court. there are five times the number on non-native people living in rocky, but there are about the same amount of natives in court as non-natives. there were five members of the beaverbones clan, two members of the goodrunning family, two redbears among others. i hope this is a rocky anomaly. if this is the case everywhere, something has to be changed. i will give them some credit. they all showed up. they know how the system works even if they don't care for it. i always thought justice was an all powerful being. a godlike figure,who slamshis gavel down. now i believe he is more of a withered, battered old man, who has seen too much and just doesn't care.

"i got a nice chuckle out of this story when i first read it. i found the article at cnn.com. what are her great-grandkids going to think? i have to say this is one criminal dane and joel might have a chance at beating up. rome, italy (reuters) italian police have arrested an 80-year-old great-grandmother suspected of drugging and robbing easily fooled victims for years to feed her gambling habit. vittoria benetti was detained after her last victim, a 70-year-old woman travelling in the same train compartment, identified her in a photo, italian media reported saturday. benetti drugged her with a cup of coffee and then escaped with 1,000 euros ($1,226) which she promptly spent at a casino in neighboring slovenia. benetti's criminal record for a string of frauds and swindles and her obsession for gambling made it easy for the police to track her down, newspapers said. i guess prison is just about as bad as an old-folks home. the difference is the abondoned, retired old people have pensions and life savings. prisoners have cigarettes. she'd probably have more fun swindling all the inheritance out of the senile fools at the care centre, not the jail.

"goats now have the ability to spin webbing. it's part two in the animals taking over the world. birds lighting entire forests on fire in californiaand now goats that can trap humans in webs. the main thing that sucks is that we're giving the goats these incredible abilities. here's a piece of the article i found on the bbc's website. (dane originally posted a linkto the article here, but since he's an inbred twit with no regard for proper formatting, ideleted it toreturn the page to it's former nicely-formatted glory. since dane is a journalist you would think he would have a grasp on the fact that there's only a limited space to work with. but i guess not. - joel) in an unlikely coupling, genetic engineers have now bred goats that have spider silk genes inside them. by doing this, they can harvest the silk proteins from the goat's milk (silky milk, anyone?). the silk gene was just one of 70,000 that make up the dna blueprint for building a normal goat. in adult female goats, the silk gene is activated only while the animal is producing milk. one goat can produce about 7g of silk per day. spiders in space and surgery called 'biosteel', the silk is lighter, yet tougher than kevlar, and nearly as elastic as nylon. it could be used in medical supplies, space equipment and bullet-proof vests. so there's a new superhero in town. swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper, fighting crime as it shoots jets of silk from its udders, it's spider-goat! the author thinks the entire thing is a joke. i can't believe it. he won't be laughing for too much longer. i've noticed thatjoel was harboring a small force ofterrorist animals at his trailer.now they're all heading their separate waysto lead larger forces in the destruction ofmankind. i wouldn't be surprised if joel trainedthem himself. after three years of dealing with peopleat rolf's, he's begun to despise all people and wants to kill them all. damn you joel. damn you. by the way everyone should check out his 52 post extravaganza at urllink _urllink_  it's pretty funny.

"as i promised/threatened before, i was going to write an installment in the adventures of drunk man and bug guy or whatever the hell their names are. and here it is! now you may go about your business now that the master of brilliant awesomeness has blessed you. of course, after you're done with him, you could always read this. issue 0, hitting blogstands now! but before i start, i'd just... screw it, i'll save it for another post. enjoy! it was a dark, or a stormy, or perhaps a dark and stormy night. lightning crashed, which pissed off the thunder, because apparently only thunder is supposed to crash. they bitched at each other for a while then whisped away to the atmosphere, leaving behind a stench of ozone. the suicidal rain drops fell to the earth and burst apart on impact, leaving behind streams of watery gore. newsprint blackness was smeared over the landscape and was everywhere. except in one area, where it was washed away by two thin streams of light. a small black car slid sharply around the corner of the gravel road. it began to drift and soon found itself hurtling into a tree. it crashed, as expected. three rather large branches came down with a thud on the hood. and then, all was quiet. all was still. for a few moments anyway, for loud screaming came from inside the car. soon after, the passenger side door opened. ""...ing asshole!!! fuck! fuck fuckity fuck fuck fuck!! who the hell do you think you are!!"" yelled joel as he stepped outside. the driver side door opened, then dane stepped outside as well. ""calm down, joel. this car cost us thirty bucks. those new red pens you bought cost more than that. and look! we're in the driveway of my house!"" ""calm down?! i'll calm down after i've urinated on your corpse, you fucking wackadoo!"" dane calmly took a cigarette out of his pocket and shoved it in joel's mouth. before joel could react, dane grabbed his lighter and lit it. joel immediately inhaled half the cigarette, then crumpled into a heap on the road. dane shook his head, grabbed joel's arms, and dragged him towards the house. after ten minutes of arduous pulling, dane zipped up his pants and went into the living room to see if joel was still alive after he had threw him on the couch twenty minutes earlier. he went back into the kitchen after he saw joel muttering about ""all the pretty puppies"". damn, dane thought to himself, all this pulling has worn me out. i'm used to pushing things! before he could curl up on the table and go to sleep, he was confronted by his girlfriend, famira! ""so, i'm still not good enough for your little adventures, am i?"" she sneered. dane lept to his feet, opened a cupboard, and hid behind it's door. ""it's just that you don't have any powers, sweetie!"" stammered dane. ""what, like you guys? wow, the ability to get drunk. that's a showstopper. and being able to push things?"" ""dammit, famira; i have a gift! i push well! and with a bit of power, comes a little responsibility!"" shouted dane as he stood up and raised his fist to the ceiling. famira shook her head. ""dane, i have a secret to tell you. you didn't get bitten by a radioactive dung beetle. you got bitten by a radioactive spider. but besides making you sterile, it didn't do anything for you."" ""but... but what about anthony? i pushed him into in a little ball!"" ""oh, him. well, it turns out he was just a big sissy."" ""and why the big story about the dung beetle?"" ""because, dear, if i told you you were bitten by a radioactive spider you would've tried jumping from buildings and stuff. this at least kept you safe on the ground."" ""but i have no powers!"" ""do you need powers to be a hero?"" ""hmmm... i guess not... wait a minute, what the fuck am i saying?! of course you need powers to be a hero! does superman save a busful of screaming passengers from going off a cliff by talking nice to the bus?"" ""sigh... you don't get it."" ""no! you know what i don't i get? how you appeared out of nowhere! you're supposed to be at work right now! and you don't even sound like you usually do! you don't talk like that! what the hell is going on?"" famira suddenly began to flicker. she was an image, projected from some unknown source. ""ha ha ha! that's right! i'm not famira! and this is the end of the line for you!"" to be continued!!! ",1

"thanks to my investigative journalism, the pentagon is now aware of the animal threat level. they are implementing programs to stop the attack. here is some proof. it's the top two paragraphs of an article on the globe and mail's website. pentagon tests directed-energy weapons by michael p. regan associated press a few months from now, peter anthony schlesinger hopes to zap a laser beam at a couple of chickens or other animals in a cage a few dozen yards away. if all goes as planned, the chickens will be frozen in mid-cluck, their leg and wing muscles paralyzed by an electrical charge created by the beam, even as their heart and lungs function normally. among those most interested in the outcome will be officials at the pentagon, who helped fund mr. schlesinger's work and are looking at this type of device to do a lot more than just zap the cluck out of a chicken. devices like these, known as directed-energy weapons, could be used to fight wars in coming years. these new ray guns will allow people to harm the animals, but not kill them. we have to crush the attack, but don't want to destroy our food supply.

"i am really disappointed today, i thought i will have a happy day today, oh well, guess that's my luck. today after school, i waited for yuk cos she said she has remedial until 6, but at the end, she couldn't find mrs neo, so we left school at 5 30. jian yong, yuk and me walk tampines mall as i suggest going for window shopping and ask them company me. at some point of time, yuk suddenly have a strong interest in talking to jian yong about some stuff, i tried to join in but failed. then we walked into tis jigsaw puzzle shop, i wanted to show yuk some of the nice pictures i saw last saturday. i found one particular puzzle with a panda and find it interesting, so i showed it to yuk. she was still so indulged in the conversation that she din even notice it. i keep asking her whether she find it nice, she didn't even reply. i tried to understand, it has been long since she talk to jian yong, so i let them chat. once in a while, i showed them some nice puzzle and ask for their opinion so that none of us will be left out. the problem came after we left the puzzle shop. they were talking about the century square cinema, and how some of the couples act in the theatre. i wasn't welcome into the conversation for some reason. i felt so bored so i decided to walk to cinema to see what movies were avialable. i swear i walked really slowly, i was strolling. but you know what? it took them days to reach to where i am. i was so bored and irritated. i mean, you asked them along and try to have conversation together, yet you are being left out and treated as if you do not exist. what is even worse is when we walk past san bookstore. ok, i was walking alone all the way from the cinema. i don't feel their presence at all. they stopped me, and said that they want to go into the bookstore, after i had walked a great distance away. and so i followed. i went in, and feel tired so i walked out to take fresh air. i don't think anyone notice me and i don't expect anyone to. i mean after being treated like non-existence for so long, would you expect anyone to notice you? after standing outside like for years, yuk suddenly remembered me. i was damn pissed off that i can't bring myself to open my mouth. anyway, all she care is jian yong is still in the bookstore and she should not neglect him. she went to check out on him and she couldn't see him. so i went in to check. i really regret going in. seriously. why? she suddenly feel rooted to where jian yong was. i walked out of the bookstore, again unnotice. i felt like an extra. any human being who can feel will feel that way, who don't agree? i strolled into yamaha to check out guitars. after like 15 mins, then they walked out, still talking. frankly, which stead will treat own bf/gf like that? when she is with her friend, i will be left out. now she is with my friend, i am also being neglected. i sacrifice my time with my friends to company her, but what about her? in her circle of friends, i am below her friends. if she rejected her friends to go out with me, she will feel that she has done a favour. but i have done this a countless times, without even complaining. i really don't know how to react. even time she neglect me, i will feel upset. i cannot tell her that, she will feel that i am possessive and over-sensitive. i fabricated countless excuses for her. i can't always blame myself for being too-sensitive, cos that i know is just an excuse for me. if you say i am jealous, yes i admit. don't talk about stead first. when you are with you group of friends, and they for some reason keep excluding you from the conversation, will you feel upset and jealous? i seldom talk to girls, not because i can't, i can if i want to. is because, i keep reminding myself that i have to be faithful to yuk. but she always talk to guys in front of me. i am always understanding, i should not be so unreasonable as to stop her from talking. but what i ask for is for her to at least show me some respect, let me feel that i am not transparent.

"hi to whoever is looking at my blog now... i do not encourage anybody from reading whatever i have posted here. reason is very simple: why do you want to read about me?! too free is it? i post whatever here for me and only me to read. if you are really such a nuisance and insist on reading, fine. there's nothing i can do. fingers are yours, eyes are yours, brain is yours... go ahead and do whatever you like! hopefully you have mental crush after reading... in case you are wondering why i am writing here, or why am i even starting this blogger thingy. i don't really know too. i am just curious about writing online journal, and how it would affect me in any way, or should i say even affect me at all. i don't like to write in a diary book, i think it's not safe as someone might steal it( don't ask me why, some people steal things for the kick of it, mental). the other reason is my hand writing is too illegible that i don't think an idiot can even imagine a word out of it. but i do admit one thing: it's better to write in a diary, it has more value( and also keep kay pos away). life is short... lives are long...*dreaming...* ehem! eh..huh?! oh oh.. i am writeing a blogger now.. pai sei pai sei... as i was saying, life is short(not lives are long). how long do you think one person can live up to? 70s? 80s? 90s? scientists claim that humans, yes us, cannot live pass 120 years of age. why? how i know? i forgot to ask them. curse? nah... no such thing. lifestyle? maybe... humans like to eat junks... humans' favorite activity is stressing themseleves up by working hard all day all night(hehe...)... or humans just prefer to die before 120 years old?( unbelievable but true). whatever it is, life is short... (sidetrack again... forgot what i wanted to say...) oh... life is short, try to think about it, how many meaningful things have you did in your past years from the day you enter this pretty world? anything worth remembering? any great achievement?(except screwing teachers up) most of you will say not really much... and i know that's a lie. the truth is, no! some of you might have... there are many things for you to achieve, but not many people grab the opportunities. why? many people think that it's no use tiring yourself up just to achieve something. they see opportunities as swayness. but try to think about it, what is the purpose of life? or should i put it this way, what is the purpose of your life? is it to step foot on this world and relax... slacking day and night(night?)... eat sleep play... come to this world with nothing, and leave the world with nothing but laziness. if you could see it the other way, instead of waiting for opportunities, look for it. when you have it, treasure it and make full use of it. give in your best and you will have one more thing to add in your achivement list. isn't your life more colourful this way? ( if you say no, close this window. if you continue reading, that means you agree with me) in this lifetime, it is inevitable that we face alot of troubles and problems... we have to make many important decisions and i admit it's very tiring. stress, the word which seems harmless, but with meaning so powerful that it kill every soul that could not suppress it. one of the reason why i am writing is to release some stress i am facing... it's better to express out in the form of writing, verbally but not physically, than to keep everything to yourself inside your heart. it might explode(literally, ever heard of heart attack?) one day. so, whenever i have problem(which is alot?), i will try to type it out(hopefully i can). some times i may also type some rubbish when i feel bored or what so ever. please don't stay tune and don't keep up to the latest updates( told you i am not writing for anyone to read except me).

"today was by far the most 'laughy' day at work i've had thus far. tim (fellow usher) and myself had been effing with each other the whole day and having a good giggle all the time. once we came upon cleaning the third showing of a cinderella story, it was ""go time"" for the dueling. we both grabbed our brooms and had a full-out brawl. i rocked him, of course. using my jkiii/rave technique to ""sweep"" him from the ground. *aha!!!* that was freakin' terrible. i then threw my broom at him in a horizontal fashion, thus smashing his shins. *chortle* going to see if the guy was alright, i leaned over him while he was bending over nursing his busted leg. then, of course, he cheap shots me right in the sac. oh man, i really did have a great laugh. that was so awesome. you got me good, tim, you got me good. as for the rest of the night: ""never as amazing as you""....i thoroughly disagree. *smile* ",0
